===Introduction to Cryptocurrency===
Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for goods and services. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.
===History of Cryptocurrency===
The first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, numerous other cryptocurrencies have been created. These are frequently called altcoins, as a blend of alternative coin. Bitcoin and its derivatives use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.
===Types of Cryptocurrency===
There are many different types of cryptocurrencies, each with its own set of features and functions. The most popular cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Dash. Bitcoin is the most widely used and accepted cryptocurrency. Ethereum is a platform that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications. Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system, currency exchange, and remittance network. Dash is a privacy-centric digital currency with instant transactions.
