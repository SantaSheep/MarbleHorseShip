===Introduction to Zscore===

Zscore is a financial metric used to measure the financial health of a company. It is a measure of the distance between a company's current financial position and its bankruptcy threshold. The Zscore is calculated using a combination of financial ratios, such as the [[Current Ratio|current ratio]], [[Quick Ratio|quick ratio]], and debt-to-equity ratio. The Zscore is used to assess the likelihood of a company going bankrupt in the near future.
===Calculation of Zscore===

The Zscore is calculated using a formula developed by Edward Altman in 1968. The formula takes into account five financial ratios: [[Working Capital|working capital]] to total assets, [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] to total assets, earnings before interest and taxes to total assets, market value of equity to [[Total Liabilities|total liabilities]], and sales to total assets. The formula is as follows:

Zscore = 1.2A + 1.4B + 3.3C + 0.6D + 1.0E

Where A = working capital to total assets, B = retained earnings to total assets,  = earnings before interest and taxes to total assets,  = market value of equity to total liabilities, and E = sales to total assets.
===Uses of Zscore===

The Zscore is used to assess the financial health of a company. It is a useful tool for investors, creditors, and other stakeholders to assess the risk of a company going bankrupt in the near future. The Zscore can also be used to compare the financial health of different companies in the same industry.
===Limitations of Zscore===

The Zscore is a useful tool for assessing the financial health of a company, but it has some limitations. The Zscore does not take into account qualitative factors, such as the management team or the competitive environment. Additionally, the Zscore does not take into account the company's [[Cash Flow|cash flow]], which is an important factor in assessing the financial health of a company.
