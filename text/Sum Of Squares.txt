===Introduction to Sum of Squares===

The Sum of Squares is a statistical measure used to quantify the amount of variation in a set of data. It is also known as the total sum of squares or the sum of squared deviations. The Sum of Squares is used in a variety of statistical applications, including regression analysis, analysis of variance, and [[Hypothesis Testing|hypothesis testing]]. It is an important tool for understanding the relationship between variables and for making predictions about future data.
===Definition of Sum of Squares===

The Sum of Squares is defined as the sum of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the data set. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the data set. The formula for calculating the Sum of Squares is:

SS = Σ (x - μ)2

Where SS is the Sum of Squares, x is each data point, and μ is the mean of the data set.
===Uses of Sum of Squares===

The Sum of Squares is used in a variety of statistical applications. It is used in regression analysis to measure the amount of variation in the data that is explained by the regression model. It is also used in analysis of variance to measure the amount of variation between different groups of data. Finally, it is used in hypothesis testing to determine whether the observed data is significantly different from the expected data.
===Examples of Sum of Squares===

To illustrate the use of the Sum of Squares, consider the following example. Suppose we have a data set consisting of 10 data points. The mean of the data set is 5. The Sum of Squares is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the data set. The formula for calculating the Sum of Squares is:

SS = Σ (x - μ)2

Where SS is the Sum of Squares, x is each data point, and μ is the mean of the data set.

In this example, the Sum of Squares is calculated as follows:

SS = (1 - 5)2 + (2 - 5)2 + (3 - 5)2 + (4 - 5)2 + (5 - 5)2 + (6 - 5)2 + (7 - 5)2 + (8 - 5)2 + (9 - 5)2 + (10 - 5)2

SS = 25

The Sum of Squares is a statistical measure used to quantify the amount of variation in a set of data. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the data set. The Sum of Squares is used in a variety of statistical applications, including regression analysis, analysis of variance, and hypothesis testing.
