===Introduction to Game Theory===

Game theory is a branch of mathematics that studies strategic decision making in situations where two or more players interact. It is used to analyze a wide range of economic, political, and social situations. Game theory is used to understand how people interact with each other and how they make decisions in order to maximize their own benefit. It is also used to analyze the behavior of firms and governments in competitive markets.
===History of Game Theory===

Game theory was first developed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s. They developed the theory to analyze economic behavior in situations where two or more players interact. Since then, game theory has been used to analyze a wide range of economic, political, and social situations. It has been used to analyze the behavior of firms and governments in competitive markets, as well as to understand how people interact with each other and how they make decisions in order to maximize their own benefit.
===Applications of Game Theory===

Game theory has a wide range of applications in economics, politics, and other [[Social Science|social science]]s. It is used to analyze the behavior of firms and governments in competitive markets, as well as to understand how people interact with each other and how they make decisions in order to maximize their own benefit. It is also used to analyze the behavior of firms and governments in oligopolistic markets, as well as to analyze the behavior of countries in international relations.
===Types of Games===

Game theory is used to analyze a wide range of games, including zero-sum games, non-zero-sum games, cooperative games, and non-cooperative games. In a zero-sum game, one player's gain is another player's loss. In a non-zero-sum game, both players can gain or lose. In a cooperative game, players can cooperate to achieve a common goal. In a non-cooperative game, players compete against each other to achieve their own goals.
===Strategies in Game Theory===

Game theory is used to analyze a wide range of strategies, including [[Nash Equilibrium|Nash equilibrium]], dominant strategies, and mixed strategies. Nash equilibrium is a strategy in which no player can gain an advantage by changing his or her strategy. Dominant strategies are strategies that are always better than any other strategy. Mixed strategies are strategies that involve a combination of different strategies.
