===Introduction to Discount Rate===
Discount rate is a term used in finance to refer to the [[Rate Of Return|rate of return]] used to discount future [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]s to their [[Present Value|present value]]. It is used to calculate the present value of a future cash flow, which is the amount of money that would be received today if the cash flow were received in the future. The discount rate is an important concept in finance, as it is used to determine the value of investments and to compare different investments.
===Types of Discount Rates===
There are two main types of discount rates: the risk-free rate and the market rate. The risk-free rate is the rate of return that would be earned on a risk-free investment, such as a government bond. The market rate is the rate of return that would be earned on a market investment, such as a stock or bond.

The risk-free rate is determined by the [[Interest Rate|interest rate]] on government bonds, while the market rate is determined by the [[Expected Return|expected return]] on market investments. Inflation affects the discount rate by increasing the cost of future cash flows, while the time value of money affects the discount rate by decreasing the value of future cash flows.
===Calculating Discount Rates===
The discount rate is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the market rate. For example, if the risk-free rate is 3% and the market rate is 5%, then the discount rate would be 2%. The discount rate can also be calculated using the present value formula, which takes into account the time value of money and inflation.
