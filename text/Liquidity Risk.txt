===Introduction to Liquidity Risk===

Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they come due. It is a risk that is inherent in all [[Financial Market|financial market]]s and can be caused by a variety of factors, including market volatility, changes in [[Interest Rate|interest rate]]s, and changes in the availability of credit. Liquidity risk can have a significant impact on an entity’s ability to meet its financial obligations and can lead to significant losses if not managed properly.
===Types of Liquidity Risk===

Liquidity risk can be divided into two main categories: market liquidity risk and funding liquidity risk. Market liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will not be able to sell its assets quickly enough to meet its financial obligations. This type of risk is often caused by market volatility or changes in the availability of credit. Funding liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will not be able to obtain the necessary funds to meet its financial obligations. This type of risk is often caused by changes in interest rates or changes in the availability of credit.
===Measuring Liquidity Risk===

Liquidity risk can be measured in a variety of ways. One of the most common methods is to calculate the ratio of [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]]s to total assets. This ratio measures the amount of liquid assets that an entity has relative to its total assets. A higher ratio indicates that the entity has more liquid assets relative to its total assets and is therefore less likely to experience liquidity risk. Other methods of measuring liquidity risk include calculating the ratio of [[Current Assets|current assets]] to [[Current Liabilities|current liabilities]], calculating the ratio of cash to total assets, and calculating the ratio of short-term investments to total assets.
===Managing Liquidity Risk===

Liquidity risk can be managed through a variety of methods. One of the most common methods is to maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets. This can be done by investing in short-term investments such as [[[[Money Market|Money Market]] Fund|money market fund]]s or [[Treasury Bill|treasury bill]]s. Another method is to maintain a sufficient level of current assets relative to current liabilities. This can be done by maintaining a sufficient level of cash and short-term investments relative to total assets. Finally, an entity can manage liquidity risk by maintaining a sufficient level of credit availability. This can be done by maintaining a good [[Credit Rating|credit rating]] and by maintaining a sufficient level of credit lines.
===Conclusion===

Liquidity risk is an [[Inherent Risk|inherent risk]] in all financial markets and can have a significant impact on an entity’s ability to meet its financial obligations. It is important for entities to understand the different types of liquidity risk and to measure and manage liquidity risk in order to minimize the potential for losses. By maintaining a sufficient level of liquid assets, current assets, and credit availability, an entity can reduce its exposure to liquidity risk and ensure that it is able to meet its finan
