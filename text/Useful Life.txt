===Introduction to Useful Life of Assets === 
The useful life of an asset is a term used to describe the length of time an asset is expected to be used and remain productive. It is an important concept in accounting and finance, as it helps to determine the depreciation of an asset and the amount of money that can be claimed as a tax deduction. The useful life of an asset is also used to determine the amount of money that should be allocated for the purchase of a new asset.
===Definition of Useful Life of Assets === 
The useful life of an asset is the estimated period of time that an asset will remain productive and generate income for the business. It is the period of time during which the asset is expected to be used and remain productive. The useful life of an asset is usually determined by the expected wear and tear of the asset, the expected technological obsolescence of the asset, and the expected economic obsolescence of the asset.
===Factors Affecting Useful Life of Assets === 
The useful life of an asset is affected by a number of factors, including the type of asset, the expected wear and tear of the asset, the expected technological obsolescence of the asset, the expected economic obsolescence of the asset, and the expected market conditions. The useful life of an asset is also affected by the expected rate of return on the asset, the expected rate of inflation, and the expected rate of technological change.
===Accounting Treatment of Useful Life of Assets === 
The useful life of an asset is used to determine the amount of depreciation that should be allocated to the asset. The depreciation of an asset is the amount of money that is allocated to the asset over its useful life.

===Examples of Useful Life of Assets ===

For example, the useful life of a computer is typically three to five years, while the useful life of a car is typically five to seven years. The useful life of a building is typically twenty to forty years, while the useful life of a piece of machinery is typically ten to fifteen years.
