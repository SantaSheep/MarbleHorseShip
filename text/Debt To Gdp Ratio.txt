===Introduction to Debt-to-GDP Ratio === 
The debt-to-GDP ratio is a measure of a country’s total debt in relation to its gross domestic product (GDP). It is used to assess a country’s ability to pay back its debt and is an important indicator of a country’s economic health. In this article, we will discuss what the debt-to-GDP ratio is, how it is calculated, what a good debt-to-GDP ratio is, and examples of countries with high and low debt-to-GDP ratios. 
===What is the Debt-to-GDP Ratio? === 
The debt-to-GDP ratio is a measure of a country’s total debt in relation to its gross domestic product (GDP). It is used to assess a country’s ability to pay back its debt and is an important indicator of a country’s economic health. The debt-to-GDP ratio is calculated by dividing a country’s total public debt by its GDP. A higher debt-to-GDP ratio indicates that a country has a higher level of debt relative to its GDP and is more likely to struggle to pay back its debt. 
===How is the Debt-to-GDP Ratio Calculated? === 
The debt-to-GDP ratio is calculated by dividing a country’s total public debt by its GDP. The total public debt includes all government debt, including bonds, loans, and other forms of debt. The GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a given year. 
===What is a Good Debt-to-GDP Ratio? === 
A good debt-to-GDP ratio is one that is low and manageable. Generally, a debt-to-GDP ratio of less than 60% is considered to be a good debt-to-GDP ratio. A debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 60% is considered to be high and may indicate that a country is at risk of defaulting on its debt. 
===Examples of Countries with High and Low Debt-to-GDP Ratios === 
Some countries have high debt-to-GDP ratios, while others have low debt-to-GDP ratios. For example, the United States has a debt-to-GDP ratio of 106.2%, while Japan has a debt-to-GDP ratio of 237.2%. On the other hand, countries such as Norway and Switzerland have low debt-to-GDP ratios of 25.2% and 33.2%, respectively. 
===Conclusion === 
The debt-to-GDP ratio is an important measure of a country’s economic health. It is calculated by dividing a country’s total public debt by its GDP. A good debt-to-GDP ratio is one that is low and manageable, generally less than 60%. Countries such as the United States and Japan have high debt-to-GDP ratios, while countries such as Norway and Switzerland have low debt-to-GDP ratios.
