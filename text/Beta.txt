===Introduction to Beta===

Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. It is used to measure the risk of a stock relative to the market as a whole. Beta is an important tool for investors to use when making decisions about which stocks to buy and sell. It is also used by financial analysts to assess the risk of a portfolio.
===Definition of Beta===

Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. It is calculated by taking the covariance of the stock's returns with the market's returns and dividing it by the variance of the market's returns. Beta is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, with 1 representing perfect correlation with the market. A stock with a beta of 1 will move in the same direction as the market, while a stock with a beta of 0 will move independently of the market.
===Uses of Beta===

Beta is used to measure the risk of a stock relative to the market as a whole. It is an important tool for investors to use when making decisions about which stocks to buy and sell. Beta can also be used to assess the risk of a portfolio. By calculating the [[Weighted Average|weighted average]] beta of the stocks in a portfolio, investors can get an idea of how the portfolio will perform in relation to the market.
===Calculating Beta===

Beta is calculated by taking the covariance of the stock's returns with the market's returns and dividing it by the variance of the market's returns. The formula for calculating beta is:

Beta = Covariance(Stock Returns, Market Returns) / Variance(Market Returns)
===Limitations of Beta===

Although beta is a useful tool for measuring the risk of a stock relative to the market, it has some limitations. Beta does not take into account the size of the company or the industry in which it operates. It also does not take into account the company's financial health or the quality of its management. As such, beta should not be used as the sole basis for making investment decisions.

It is used to measure the risk of a stock relative to the market as a whole and is an important tool for investors to use when making decisions about which stocks to buy and sell.
