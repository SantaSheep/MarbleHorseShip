===Introduction to Abm===
Activity-based management (ABM) is a management approach that focuses on activities within an organization to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization. It is a process that helps organizations identify, measure, and manage activities that are essential to the success of the organization. ABM is used to identify and eliminate non-value-added activities, improve the efficiency of existing activities, and create new activities that will add value to the organization. ABM is a comprehensive approach to managing an organization's resources and activities to achieve its goals.
===History of Abm===
Activity-based management was first developed in the 1980s by Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton. They developed the concept of ABM as a way to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of organizations. The concept of ABM was based on the idea that organizations should focus on activities rather than outputs. This was a radical departure from traditional management approaches, which focused on outputs rather than activities. ABM was initially used in manufacturing and service organizations, but it has since been applied to a wide range of organizations.
===Types of Abm===
There are three main types of ABM: strategic, operational, and tactical. Strategic ABM focuses on the long-term goals of the organization and how to achieve them. Operational ABM focuses on the day-to-day activities of the organization and how to improve them. Tactical ABM focuses on the short-term goals of the organization and how to achieve them.
