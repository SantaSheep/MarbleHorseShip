===Introduction to Conditional Probability === 
Conditional probability is a branch of probability theory that deals with the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. Conditional probability is used to calculate the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is a powerful tool for making decisions and predicting outcomes.
===Examples of Conditional Probability === 
One of the most common examples of conditional probability is the probability of a coin landing on heads given that it has already landed on tails. In this example, the probability of the coin landing on heads is 0.5, given that it has already landed on tails. Another example is the probability of a person getting a job given that they have already applied for the job. In this example, the probability of the person getting the job is dependent on the number of applicants and the qualifications of the applicants.
===Calculating Conditional Probability === 
The formula for calculating conditional probability is P(A
===Applications of Conditional Probability === 
B) = P(A and B) / P(B). This formula states that the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred is equal to the probability of both events occurring divided by the probability of event B occurring.
===Limitations of Conditional Probability === 
Conditional probability is used in many different fields, including finance, medicine, and engineering. In finance, it is used to calculate the probability of a stock price increasing given that the market has already increased. In medicine, it is used to calculate the probability of a patient having a certain disease given that they have already been diagnosed with another disease. In engineering, it is used to calculate the probability of a machine failing given that it has already been tested.
===Conclusion === 
One of the main limitations of conditional probability is that it does not take into account all of the factors that may affect the outcome of an event. For example, in the coin example, the probability of the coin landing on heads given that it has already landed on tails does not take into account the weight of the coin or the force with which it was thrown.
