===Introduction to Preferred Stock===

Preferred stock is a type of security that is issued by a company and is similar to common stock, but with some key differences. Preferred stock is a hybrid security that combines features of both debt and equity. It is a form of equity that pays a fixed dividend and has priority over common stock in the event of a liquidation. Preferred stockholders have a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stockholders, but they do not have voting rights.
===Types of Preferred Stock===

There are several different types of preferred stock, each with its own unique features. The most common types of preferred stock are cumulative preferred stock, non-cumulative preferred stock, convertible preferred stock, and callable preferred stock. Cumulative preferred stock pays dividends that accumulate if they are not paid in a given year. Non-cumulative preferred stock does not accumulate unpaid dividends. Convertible preferred stock can be converted into common stock at a predetermined price. Callable preferred stock can be redeemed by the issuer at a predetermined price.
