===Introduction to Balance Sheet===

A balance sheet is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of a company’s financial position at a given point in time. It is one of the three primary [[Financial Statements|financial statements]] used to assess a company’s financial health, along with the [[Income Statement|income statement]] and the statement of [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]s. The balance sheet is also known as the statement of financial position.

The balance sheet is divided into two sections: assets and liabilities. Assets are resources owned by the company, while liabilities are obligations owed to creditors.

The balance sheet is used to assess the financial health of a company by providing a snapshot of its financial position.
===Components of a Balance Sheet===

The balance sheet is composed of three main components: assets, liabilities, and equity. Assets are resources owned by the company, such as cash, [[Accounts Receivable|accounts receivable]], inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. Liabilities are obligations owed to creditors, such as [[Accounts Payable|accounts payable]], loans, and bonds. Equity is the net worth of the company, which is the difference between assets and liabilities.

The balance sheet also includes other items such as investments, deferred taxes, and other non-[[Current Assets|current assets]] and liabilities.
