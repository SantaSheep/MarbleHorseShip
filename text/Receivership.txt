Receivership is often used when a company is insolvent or facing bankruptcy. It is also used in cases of fraud or mismanagement.
===Types of Receivership===

There are two main types of receivership: voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary receivership occurs when a company voluntarily petitions the court for a receiver to be appointed. This is usually done when the company is facing financial difficulties and needs help managing its assets.
