===Introduction to Capitalization - What is Capitalization?=== 
Capitalization is the process of raising funds for a business by issuing debt or equity securities. It is a way for companies to access capital to finance their operations, investments, and growth. Capitalization is an important part of a company’s financial structure and can have a significant impact on its value.
===Types of Capitalization - Debt vs=== 
Capitalization can be divided into two main types: debt and equity. Debt capitalization involves the issuance of debt securities such as bonds or loans. Equity capitalization involves the issuance of equity securities such as stocks or preferred shares.

Capitalization can provide a company with access to funds that can be used to finance operations, investments, and growth. It can also increase the company’s valuation by providing a source of capital that can be used to increase the company’s assets and earnings.

Capitalization can also have its drawbacks. One of the main challenges is the dilution of ownership that can occur when a company issues equity securities. This can lead to a decrease in the value of existing shareholders’ stakes in the company. Additionally, capitalization can increase the company’s risk profile by increasing its debt burden.
