===Definition of Clo===

Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) are a type of structured finance product that is used to securitize a pool of loans. The loans are typically corporate loans, but can also include consumer loans, such as auto loans and student loans. The loans are pooled together and then sold to investors in the form of bonds. The bonds are then rated by credit rating agencies, such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's, and the ratings are used to determine the risk associated with the bonds. The bonds are then sold to investors, who can then use them to generate income.

The concept of Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) was first developed in the late 1990s as a way to securitize a pool of loans.
