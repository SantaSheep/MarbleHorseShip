===Introduction to Money Supply===
Money supply is a term used to describe the total amount of money in circulation in an economy. It is an important economic indicator that is used to measure the health of an economy. Money supply is typically measured by the central bank of a country and is used to determine the level of economic activity in the country. The money supply is composed of currency in circulation, deposits held by banks, and other forms of money such as traveler’s checks and money orders.
===Types of Money Supply===
