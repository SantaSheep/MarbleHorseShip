===Introduction to Overextension===

Overextension is a financial term that refers to the situation in which an individual or business has taken on too much debt or has too many liabilities relative to their assets. This can lead to a situation in which the individual or business is unable to meet their financial obligations and is at risk of defaulting on their loans or other debts. Overextension can be caused by a variety of factors, including taking on too much debt, not having enough assets to cover liabilities, or not having enough [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] to cover expenses. It is important to understand the causes and effects of overextension in order to avoid it and maintain financial stability.
===Causes of Overextension===

There are several potential causes of overextension. One of the most common causes is taking on too much debt. This can occur when an individual or business takes out loans or other forms of debt that they are unable to pay back. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the terms of the loan or an overestimation of their ability to pay back the loan.

This can occur when an individual or business has taken on too much debt relative to their assets, leaving them unable to cover their liabilities.

This can occur when an individual or business has taken on too much debt relative to their income, leaving them unable to cover their expenses.

Finally, overextension can lead to bankruptcy, which can have serious long-term consequences such as the loss of assets and difficulty obtaining future credit.
