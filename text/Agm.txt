===Introduction to AGM===

An Annual General Meeting (AGM) is a meeting of shareholders of a company or other organization, typically held once a year. At the AGM, shareholders are given the opportunity to vote on important matters such as the election of directors, the approval of [[Financial Statements|financial statements]], and the appointment of auditors. The AGM is also a forum for shareholders to ask questions and receive answers from the [[Board Of Directors|board of directors]].
===History of AGM===

The concept of an AGM has been around since the early days of corporate law. The first AGM was held in England in 1773, and the practice quickly spread to other countries. In the United States, the first AGM was held in 1811. Since then, AGMs have become a standard part of [[Corporate Governance|corporate governance]].
===Types of AGM===

There are two main types of AGMs: physical and virtual. A physical AGM is held in person, usually at the company’s headquarters or a nearby venue. A virtual AGM is held online, using video conferencing or other digital tools.
===Benefits of AGM===

AGMs provide a number of benefits to shareholders. They allow shareholders to stay informed about the company’s performance and strategy, and to have a say in important decisions. AGMs also provide an opportunity for shareholders to meet and network with other shareholders and the board of directors.
===Challenges of AGM===

Despite the benefits of AGMs, there are some challenges associated with them. AGMs can be expensive to organize and attend, and they can be time-consuming. Additionally, virtual AGMs can be difficult to organize and manage, and they may not provide the same level of engagement as physical AGMs.
