The table is based on the mortality rates of a population over a period of time. It is used to estimate the life expectancy of a population and to calculate the expected number of deaths in a given year. The table is also used to calculate the expected number of survivors in a given year.
===History of Ultimate Mortality Table===

The Ultimate Mortality Table was first developed in the late 19th century by the British actuary William Farr. Farr developed the table to calculate the mortality rate of a population. The table was later adopted by the United States and other countries. The table has been updated over the years to reflect changes in mortality rates.
===Uses of Ultimate Mortality Table===

The Ultimate Mortality Table is used by actuaries, insurance companies, and other [[Financial Institution|financial institution]]s to calculate the probability of death for a given age group. It is also used to calculate the expected number of deaths in a given year. The table is used to estimate the life expectancy of a population and to calculate the expected number of survivors in a given year.
===Calculating Ultimate Mortality Table===

The Ultimate Mortality Table is calculated using a variety of factors including age, gender, and health status. The table is based on the mortality rates of a population over a period of time. The table is updated periodically to reflect changes in mortality rates.
