===Introduction to Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) === 
The Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) is an important economic concept that measures the amount of additional consumption that results from an increase in disposable income. It is a key indicator of how much of an increase in income is spent on goods and services, and how much is saved. It is also used to measure the impact of fiscal policy on the economy.
===Definition of MPC === 
The Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) is defined as the ratio of the change in consumption to the change in disposable income. It is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the change in consumption by the change in disposable income.
===Factors Affecting MPC === 
The MPC is affected by a number of factors, including the level of disposable income, the level of savings, the level of taxes, and the level of government spending.
===Examples of MPC === 
An example of the MPC is when a person receives a raise in their salary. If the person spends all of the additional income on goods and services, then the MPC is 100%. If the person saves half of the additional income, then the MPC is 50%.
===Calculating MPC === 
The MPC can be calculated by dividing the change in consumption by the change in disposable income. For example, if a person receives a raise of $1,000 and spends $500 of it on goods and services, then the MPC is 50%.
===Conclusion=== 
The Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) is an important economic concept that measures the amount of additional consumption that results from an increase in disposable income. It is affected by a number of factors, including the level of disposable income, the level of savings, the level of taxes, and the level of government spending. The MPC can be calculated by dividing the change in consumption by the change in disposable income. Understanding the MPC is important for understanding the impact of fiscal policy on the economy.
