===Introduction to Identifiable Assets === 
Identifiable assets are tangible or intangible assets that can be identified and measured. They are assets that can be separated from the company and sold, transferred, or exchanged. Identifiable assets are also known as “separable assets” or “distinguishable assets” and are used to measure the value of a company. Identifiable assets are important for financial reporting and analysis, as they provide a clear picture of a company’s financial health.
===Types of Identifiable Assets === 
Identifiable assets can be divided into two main categories: tangible and intangible assets. Tangible assets are physical assets that can be seen and touched, such as land, buildings, equipment, and inventory. Intangible assets are non-physical assets that have value, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and goodwill.
===Accounting for Identifiable Assets === 
When accounting for identifiable assets, companies must record the cost of the asset, the depreciation of the asset, and any gains or losses associated with the asset. Companies must also record any impairment losses associated with the asset. Impairment losses occur when the value of the asset decreases due to changes in the market or other factors.
===Valuation of Identifiable Assets === 
The value of identifiable assets is determined by the market value of the asset. This is the amount that the asset could be sold for in the open market. Companies must also consider the cost of the asset, the depreciation of the asset, and any impairment losses associated with the asset when determining the value of the asset.
===Examples of Identifiable Assets === 
Some examples of identifiable assets include land, buildings, equipment, inventory, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and goodwill.
