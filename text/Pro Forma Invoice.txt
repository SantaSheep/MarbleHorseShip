===What is a Pro Forma Invoice? === 
A pro forma invoice is a document that is used to provide an estimate of goods or services to a customer before the actual invoice is issued. It is not a legally binding document, but it is used to provide an estimate of the cost of goods or services that will be provided. The pro forma invoice is typically used in international trade, where the buyer and seller may not be familiar with each other’s currency or payment terms. It is also used in domestic trade when the buyer and seller are not familiar with each other’s payment terms.
===Benefits of Using Pro Forma Invoices === 
Pro forma invoices provide a number of benefits to both buyers and sellers. For buyers, pro forma invoices provide an estimate of the cost of goods or services before they are purchased. This allows buyers to budget for the purchase and to make sure that they are getting the best deal. For sellers, pro forma invoices provide an opportunity to negotiate the price of goods or services before the actual invoice is issued. This allows sellers to maximize their profits and to ensure that they are getting the best price for their goods or services.
===How to Create a Pro Forma Invoice === 
Creating a pro forma invoice is relatively simple. The first step is to determine the cost of the goods or services that will be provided. This should include the cost of the goods or services, any taxes or fees that may be applicable, and any shipping or handling charges. Once the cost of the goods or services has been determined, the seller should create a document that includes the cost of the goods or services, the payment terms, and any other relevant information.
===Common Mistakes to Avoid When Creating Pro Forma Invoices === 
When creating a pro forma invoice, it is important to avoid common mistakes. One of the most common mistakes is to include inaccurate information on the invoice.
