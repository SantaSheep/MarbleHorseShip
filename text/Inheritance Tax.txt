Inheritance Tax is a tax imposed by the government on the transfer of assets from one person to another. It is a form of taxation that is imposed on the estate of a deceased person, and is paid by the beneficiaries of the estate.

===Who Pays Inheritance Tax? ===

===Exemptions and Reliefs === 
There are a number of exemptions and reliefs available to reduce the amount of Inheritance Tax due. These include the transferable nil rate band, which allows the transfer of unused Inheritance Tax threshold from a deceased spouse or civil partner to the surviving spouse or civil partner. There are also a number of other reliefs available, such as business property relief and agricultural property relief.
===How to Pay Inheritance Tax === 
Inheritance Tax is paid to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The beneficiaries of the estate are responsible for paying the Inheritance Tax due, and must do so within six months of the date of death. Payment can be made by cheque, bank transfer, or credit card.
