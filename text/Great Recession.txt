===Introduction to the Great Recession===

The Great Recession was a period of economic decline that began in late 2007 and lasted until mid-2009. It was the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Great Recession was characterized by a sharp decline in economic activity, a sharp rise in unemployment, and a sharp decline in asset prices. The Great Recession was caused by a combination of factors, including the bursting of the housing bubble, the collapse of the financial sector, and the global economic slowdown. The impact of the Great Recession was felt around the world, with many countries experiencing a sharp decline in economic activity and a rise in unemployment.
===Causes of the Great Recession===

The Great Recession was caused by a combination of factors, including the bursting of the housing bubble, the collapse of the financial sector, and the global economic slowdown. The housing bubble was caused by a combination of low [[Interest Rate|interest rate]]s, lax lending standards, and speculation in the housing market. This led to a rapid increase in house prices, which eventually became unsustainable. When the bubble burst, it caused a sharp decline in house prices, leading to a wave of foreclosures and a sharp decline in consumer spending. The collapse of the financial sector was caused by a combination of factors, including the subprime mortgage crisis, the failure of Lehman Brothers, and the failure of other large [[Financial Institution|financial institution]]s. These events caused a sharp decline in the availability of credit, leading to a sharp decline in economic activity. The global economic slowdown was caused by a combination of factors, including the rising cost of oil, the decline in global demand for goods and services, and the global financial crisis.
===Impact of the Great Recession===

The impact of the Great Recession was felt around the world, with many countries experiencing a sharp decline in economic activity and a rise in unemployment. In the United States, the unemployment rate rose from 4.7% in December 2007 to 10.0% in October 2009. This was the highest rate of unemployment since the Great Depression. The decline in economic activity was also felt around the world, with many countries experiencing a sharp decline in GDP. In the United States, GDP declined by 4.3% in 2009, the largest decline since 1946.
===Recovery from the Great Recession===

The recovery from the Great Recession began in mid-2009 and has continued to the present day. The recovery has been characterized by a slow but steady increase in economic activity and a gradual decline in unemployment. In the United States, the unemployment rate has declined from 10.0% in October 2009 to 6.7% in December 2020. This is still higher than the pre-recession rate of 4.7%, but it is a significant improvement from the peak of 10.0%.
