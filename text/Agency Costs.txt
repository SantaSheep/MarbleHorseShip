===Introduction to Agency Costs === 
Agency costs are the costs associated with the conflict of interest between the principal and the agent. The principal is the person or entity that hires the agent to act on their behalf. The agent is the person or entity that is hired to act on behalf of the principal. Agency costs arise when the interests of the principal and the agent are not aligned. This can lead to the agent taking actions that are not in the best interest of the principal.
===Types of Agency Costs === 
There are three main types of agency costs: monitoring costs, bonding costs, and residual costs. Monitoring costs are the costs associated with monitoring the agent’s activities to ensure that they are acting in the best interest of the principal. Bonding costs are the costs associated with incentivizing the agent to act in the best interest of the principal. Residual costs are the costs associated with the agent’s actions that are not in the best interest of the principal.
===Examples of Agency Costs === 
A common example of agency costs is the cost of monitoring the activities of a corporate executive. The principal (the company) hires the agent (the executive) to act on their behalf. The company must monitor the executive’s activities to ensure that they are acting in the best interest of the company. This monitoring can be costly and can lead to agency costs.
