===Introduction to Extraordinary Items === 
Extraordinary items are non-recurring, unusual, and infrequent transactions that are reported separately from the ordinary income and expenses of a business. These items are not part of the normal operations of a business and are not expected to occur in the future. They are reported on the income statement as a separate line item and are not included in the calculation of net income.
===Types of Extraordinary Items === 
Extraordinary items can be either gains or losses. Gains are items that result in a positive impact on the income statement, while losses are items that result in a negative impact. Examples of extraordinary items include natural disasters, litigation settlements, and asset write-downs.
===Accounting Treatment of Extraordinary Items === 
Extraordinary items are reported on the income statement as a separate line item and are not included in the calculation of net income. They are also not included in the calculation of earnings per share (EPS).
===Examples of Extraordinary Items === 
Examples of extraordinary items include natural disasters, litigation settlements, and asset write-downs. Natural disasters can include floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Litigation settlements can include legal fees, court costs, and damages awarded. Asset write-downs can include the write-down of inventory, plant and equipment, and intangible assets.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of Extraordinary Items ===
