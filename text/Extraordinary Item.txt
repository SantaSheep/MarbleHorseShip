===Introduction to Extraordinary Items===

Extraordinary items are non-recurring, unusual, and infrequent items that are reported separately from the normal [[Operating Activities|operating activities]] of a business. These items are reported on the [[Income Statement|income statement]] and are not part of the company’s regular operations. They are typically one-time events that are not expected to occur again in the future. Examples of extraordinary items include natural disasters, lawsuits, and other non-recurring events.
===Types of Extraordinary Items===

Extraordinary items can be classified into two categories: gains and losses. Gains are items that result in an increase in [[Net Income|net income]], while losses are items that result in a decrease in net income. Examples of gains include the sale of a business, the sale of a long-term asset, and the receipt of an insurance settlement. Examples of losses include the write-off of a long-term asset, the write-off of a loan, and the settlement of a lawsuit.
