===Introduction to Debt-Equity Ratio===

The debt-equity ratio is a financial metric used to measure the relative proportion of a company’s debt and equity. It is calculated by dividing a company’s [[Total Liabilities|total liabilities]] by its total shareholders’ equity. The debt-equity ratio is also known as the [[Leverage Ratio|leverage ratio]] or the debt-to-equity ratio. It is an important measure of a company’s financial health and is used by investors and creditors to assess the risk associated with investing in or lending to a company.
===Calculation of Debt-Equity Ratio===

The debt-equity ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its total shareholders’ equity. The formula for calculating the debt-equity ratio is as follows:

Debt-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders’ Equity

The total liabilities of a company include all of its short-term and long-term debt, such as bank loans, bonds, and other forms of debt. The total shareholders’ equity includes the company’s [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]], common stock, and other equity instruments.

A low debt-equity ratio, on the other hand, indicates that a company is less leveraged and may be able to better manage its debt obligations.
