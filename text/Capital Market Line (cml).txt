===Introduction to Capital Market Line (CML) === 
The Capital Market Line (CML) is a graphical representation of the relationship between the expected return of a security and its risk. It is used to determine the optimal portfolio of securities for a given level of risk. The CML is a useful tool for investors to understand the trade-off between risk and return when constructing a portfolio.
===What is the Capital Market Line? === 
The Capital Market Line (CML) is a graphical representation of the relationship between the expected return of a security and its risk. It is used to determine the optimal portfolio of securities for a given level of risk. The CML is a line that plots the expected return of a portfolio against its risk. The CML is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which states that the expected return of a security is equal to the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The risk premium is determined by the security’s beta, which is a measure of its volatility relative to the market.

===Advantages of the Capital Market Line === 
The Capital Market Line (CML) is a useful tool for investors to understand the trade-off between risk and return when constructing a portfolio. The CML helps investors identify the optimal portfolio of securities for a given level of risk. It also helps investors identify the securities with the highest expected return for a given level of risk. The CML is also useful for portfolio managers to identify the optimal mix of securities for a given level of risk.
===Disadvantages of the Capital Market Line === 
The Capital Market Line (CML) is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which is a theoretical model and may not accurately reflect the actual relationship between risk and return. The CML also assumes that all investors have the same risk preferences, which may not be the case in reality. Additionally, the CML does not take into account the effects of taxes, transaction costs, and other factors that may affect the expected return of a security.
===Conclusion=== 
The Capital Market Line (CML) is a graphical representation of the relationship between the expected return of a security and its risk. It is used to determine the optimal portfolio of securities for a given level of risk. The CML is a useful tool for investors to understand the trade-off between risk and return when constructing a portfolio. However, the CML is based on a theoretical model and may not accurately reflect the actual relationship between risk and return. Additionally, the CML does not take into account the effects of taxes, transaction costs, and other factors that may affect the expected return of a security.
