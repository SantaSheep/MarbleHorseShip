===Introduction to Reverse Stock Splits === 
A reverse stock split is a corporate action in which a company reduces the total number of its outstanding shares by canceling some of them and replacing them with a smaller number of new shares. This action is usually taken to increase the stock price of the company, as the fewer shares outstanding will result in a higher price per share. Reverse stock splits are also known as stock consolidations or stock mergers.
===Reasons for a Reverse Stock Split === 
A reverse stock split is usually done to increase the stock price of a company. This is because the fewer shares outstanding will result in a higher price per share. Companies may also do a reverse stock split to make their stock more attractive to investors, as a higher stock price may make the company appear more stable and reliable. Additionally, some companies may do a reverse stock split to meet the requirements of certain stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, which require a minimum stock price for listing.
===How a Reverse Stock Split Works === 
When a company does a reverse stock split, it reduces the total number of its outstanding shares by canceling some of them and replacing them with a smaller number of new shares. For example, if a company does a 1-for-2 reverse stock split, it will cancel one share and replace it with two new shares. This means that the total number of outstanding shares will be reduced by half.
