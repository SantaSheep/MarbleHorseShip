===Introduction to Child Tax Credit === 
The Child Tax Credit is a federal tax credit that is available to families with children under the age of 17. This credit is designed to help offset the costs of raising a child, such as childcare, medical expenses, and educational costs. The credit is available to both single and married taxpayers, and can be claimed for each qualifying child in the household.
===Eligibility Requirements === 
In order to be eligible for the Child Tax Credit, the taxpayer must meet certain criteria. The child must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien, and must be under the age of 17 at the end of the tax year. The child must also be claimed as a dependent on the taxpayer’s tax return. Additionally, the taxpayer must have a valid Social Security Number for the child.
===How to Claim the Credit === 
The Child Tax Credit can be claimed on the taxpayer’s federal income tax return. The taxpayer must complete Form 1040 or 1040A, and attach Schedule 8812 to the return. The taxpayer must also provide the Social Security Number of the qualifying child.
===Maximum Credit Amounts === 
The maximum credit amount for the Child Tax Credit is $2,000 per qualifying child. The credit is reduced if the taxpayer’s income exceeds certain thresholds. The credit is also reduced if the taxpayer has three or more qualifying children.
===Additional Resources === 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides additional information about the Child Tax Credit on its website. The IRS also offers a free online tool to help taxpayers determine their eligibility for the credit.
===Example of a Family Claiming the Credit=== 
John and Mary Smith have two children, ages 8 and 10. They are both U.S. citizens and are claimed as dependents on the Smiths’ tax return. The Smiths have a combined income of $75,000, which is below the threshold for the Child Tax Credit. They are eligible to claim the credit for both children, for a total of $4,000. They will complete Form 1040 and attach Schedule 8812 to their return, and provide the Social Security Numbers of their children.
