===Introduction to Incoterms===
Incoterms, or International Commercial Terms, are a set of international rules developed by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) to define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international trade. Incoterms are used to determine who is responsible for the costs and risks associated with the transportation of goods from one country to another. They are also used to define the point at which ownership of the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer. Incoterms are an essential part of international trade and are used by businesses of all sizes to ensure that their transactions are conducted in a fair and transparent manner.
===Types of Incoterms===
Incoterms are divided into two categories: Ex Works (EXW) and Free Carrier (FCA). Ex Works terms are used when the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to the buyer’s premises. The buyer is then responsible for arranging and paying for the transportation of the goods. Free Carrier terms are used when the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to a designated carrier, who is then responsible for transporting the goods to the buyer’s premises.
===Incoterms and International Trade===
