===Introduction to Stock Splits===

A stock split is a corporate action in which a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares. This is done to reduce the price of each share, making them more affordable for investors. The total [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] of the company remains the same, but the number of shares outstanding increases. Stock splits are typically done in order to make the stock more attractive to investors, as well as to increase liquidity in the stock.
===Types of Stock Splits===

There are two main types of stock splits: forward splits and [[Reverse Split|reverse split]]s. A forward split is when a company increases the number of shares outstanding by dividing each share into multiple shares. For example, if a company has a 2-for-1 forward split, each share will be divided into two shares. A reverse split is when a company reduces the number of shares outstanding by combining multiple shares into one share. For example, if a company has a 1-for-2 reverse split, two shares will be combined into one share.
