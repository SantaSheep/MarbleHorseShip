===Introduction to Stock Splits === 
Stock splits are a common financial tool used by companies to adjust the price of their stock and make it more accessible to a wider range of investors. A stock split is a corporate action in which a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares to boost the liquidity of the stock. This article will provide an overview of stock splits, including what they are, the benefits and drawbacks, and an example of a stock split.
===What is a Stock Split? === 
A stock split is a corporate action in which a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares. This is done to boost the liquidity of the stock and make it more accessible to a wider range of investors. For example, if a company has 100 shares of stock and decides to do a 2-for-1 stock split, the company would then have 200 shares of stock. The price of each share would be cut in half, but the total value of the company would remain the same.
===Benefits of a Stock Split === 
One of the main benefits of a stock split is that it can make a stock more accessible to a wider range of investors. By reducing the price of the stock, more investors can afford to purchase it. This can lead to increased liquidity and higher trading volumes, which can benefit the company in the long run. Additionally, a stock split can also make a stock more attractive to investors, as it can make the stock appear to be more affordable.
===Drawbacks of a Stock Split === 
One of the drawbacks of a stock split is that it can lead to increased volatility in the stock price. This is because the stock price is being adjusted, which can lead to investors buying and selling the stock more frequently. Additionally, a stock split can also lead to a decrease in the company’s earnings per share, as the number of shares has increased but the total earnings have not.
===Example of a Stock Split === 
One example of a stock split is Apple’s 7-for-1 stock split in 2014. Prior to the split, Apple’s stock was trading at around $645 per share. After the split, the stock price was reduced to around $92 per share. This made the stock more accessible to a wider range of investors, and the stock price subsequently rose to over $100 per share.
===Conclusion=== 
Stock splits are a common financial tool used by companies to adjust the price of their stock and make it more accessible to a wider range of investors. While there are benefits to a stock split, such as increased liquidity and more attractive stock prices, there are also drawbacks, such as increased volatility and decreased earnings per share. It is important for investors to understand the implications of a stock split before investing in a company’s stock.
