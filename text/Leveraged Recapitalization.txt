===Introduction to Leveraged Recapitalization === 
Leveraged recapitalization is a financial strategy used by companies to restructure their capital structure and increase their financial leverage. It involves the issuance of new debt and the repurchase of existing equity, resulting in a higher debt-to-equity ratio. This strategy is often used to increase the company’s return on equity and to reduce the cost of capital. It can also be used to increase the company’s financial flexibility and to reduce the risk of bankruptcy.
===Benefits of Leveraged Recapitalization === 
The primary benefit of leveraged recapitalization is that it can increase the company’s return on equity. By increasing the debt-to-equity ratio, the company can increase its return on equity without having to increase its equity base. This can be beneficial for companies that are looking to increase their profitability without having to raise additional capital. Additionally, leveraged recapitalization can also reduce the cost of capital by reducing the company’s interest expense.
===Risks of Leveraged Recapitalization === 
The primary risk of leveraged recapitalization is that it increases the company’s financial leverage. This can be beneficial in some cases, but it can also increase the risk of bankruptcy if the company is unable to service its debt. Additionally, leveraged recapitalization can also reduce the company’s financial flexibility, as the company will be more reliant on debt financing.
===Examples of Leveraged Recapitalization === 
One of the most famous examples of leveraged recapitalization is the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988. In this case, the company was taken private by a group of investors who used a combination of debt and equity to finance the transaction. This transaction resulted in a significant increase in the company’s debt-to-equity ratio, which allowed the company to increase its return on equity.
===Tax Implications of Leveraged Recapitalization === 
The tax implications of leveraged recapitalization depend on the type of debt used to finance the transaction. If the debt is classified as equity, then the interest payments on the debt are not tax deductible. However, if the debt is classified as debt, then the interest payments are tax deductible. Additionally, the company may be able to take advantage of certain tax benefits, such as accelerated depreciation or tax credits.
