===Introduction to Hostile Takeovers === 
A hostile takeover is a type of corporate takeover where a bidder acquires a target company against the wishes of the target company’s board of directors. Hostile takeovers are usually initiated by a bidder who is not satisfied with the terms of a proposed merger or acquisition and instead seeks to acquire the target company without the approval of the target company’s board of directors. Hostile takeovers are often seen as a way for a bidder to gain control of a company without having to negotiate with the target company’s board of directors.
===Types of Hostile Takeovers === 
There are two main types of hostile takeovers: tender offers and proxy fights. A tender offer is a public offer to purchase a certain number of shares of a target company at a specified price. A proxy fight is a battle between a bidder and the target company’s board of directors for control of the company. In a proxy fight, the bidder attempts to gain control of the company by convincing shareholders to vote in favor of the bidder’s proposals.
===Reasons for Hostile Takeovers === 
Hostile takeovers are often initiated by a bidder who believes that the target company is undervalued or that the target company’s board of directors is not acting in the best interests of the company’s shareholders. Hostile takeovers can also be initiated by a bidder who believes that the target company’s assets are underutilized or that the target company’s management is not taking advantage of potential opportunities.
===Benefits of Hostile Takeovers === 
Hostile takeovers can be beneficial for both the bidder and the target company. For the bidder, a hostile takeover can provide access to the target company’s assets and resources, which can be used to increase the bidder’s profits. For the target company, a hostile takeover can provide access to new capital and resources, which can be used to increase the company’s profits.
===Risks of Hostile Takeovers === 
Hostile takeovers can be risky for both the bidder and the target company. For the bidder, a hostile takeover can be expensive and time-consuming, and the bidder may not be able to gain control of the target company. For the target company, a hostile takeover can lead to a loss of control and a decrease in the company’s value.
===Example of a Hostile Takeover=== 
One example of a hostile takeover is the hostile takeover of Time Warner by AT&T in 2018. AT&T offered to purchase Time Warner for $85 billion, but Time Warner’s board of directors rejected the offer. AT&T then launched a hostile takeover bid, offering to purchase Time Warner for $107 billion. After a lengthy battle, AT&T was able to gain control of Time Warner and the two companies merged in 2018.
