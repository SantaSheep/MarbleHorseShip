===Types of Commercial Paper===

There are two main types of commercial paper: secured and unsecured. Secured commercial paper is backed by collateral, such as [[Real Estate|real estate]] or other assets, while unsecured commercial paper is not backed by any collateral. In addition, there are two other types of commercial paper: asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) and structured commercial paper (SCP). ABCP is backed by a pool of assets, such as mortgages or auto loans, while SCP is backed by a derivative instrument, such as a [[Futures Contract|futures contract]] or an option.

For investors, commercial paper offers a relatively safe investment, as it is typically backed by the issuer’s creditworthiness.

For example, if the issuer defaults on the paper, the investor may not be able to recover the full amount of the investment. In addition, the value of the paper may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or the issuer’s creditworthiness. Finally, commercial paper is not insured by the FDIC, so investors should be aware of the risks associated with investing in this type of instrument.
