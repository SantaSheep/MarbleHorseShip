===Introduction to Incremental Analysis === 
Incremental analysis is a type of financial analysis that focuses on the changes in a company’s financial performance over time. It is used to evaluate the impact of a particular decision or action on the company’s financial performance. Incremental analysis is also known as differential analysis, marginal analysis, or marginal costing. It is a powerful tool for managers to make decisions that will have a positive impact on the company’s bottom line.
===Types of Incremental Analysis === 
There are two main types of incremental analysis: fixed cost analysis and variable cost analysis. Fixed cost analysis looks at the impact of a decision on the company’s fixed costs, such as rent, salaries, and insurance. Variable cost analysis looks at the impact of a decision on the company’s variable costs, such as materials, labor, and energy.
===Benefits of Incremental Analysis === 
Incremental analysis is a powerful tool for managers to make decisions that will have a positive impact on the company’s bottom line. It helps managers to identify areas where costs can be reduced and profits can be increased. It also helps managers to identify areas where investments can be made to increase profits.
===Example of Incremental Analysis === 
For example, a company may be considering investing in a new piece of equipment. The company can use incremental analysis to evaluate the impact of the investment on the company’s bottom line. The company can look at the fixed costs associated with the investment, such as the cost of the equipment, installation costs, and maintenance costs. The company can also look at the variable costs associated with the investment, such as the cost of materials, labor, and energy.
===Limitations of Incremental Analysis === 
Incremental analysis is a powerful tool, but it has its limitations. It does not take into account the long-term effects of a decision. It also does not take into account external factors, such as the economic environment or the competitive landscape.
===Conclusion === 
Incremental analysis is a powerful tool for managers to make decisions that will have a positive impact on the company’s bottom line. It helps managers to identify areas where costs can be reduced and profits can be increased. However, it has its limitations and should be used in conjunction with other financial analysis tools.
