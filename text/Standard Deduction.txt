===Introduction to Standard Deduction===

The Standard Deduction is a tax deduction that is available to taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions. It is a fixed amount that is determined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and is based on the taxpayer’s filing status. The Standard Deduction is designed to reduce the amount of [[Taxable Income|taxable income]] for taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions. It is an important part of the U.S. tax system and is used by millions of taxpayers each year.
===History of Standard Deduction===

The Standard Deduction was first introduced in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Prior to this, taxpayers were required to itemize their deductions in order to receive any tax benefit. The Standard Deduction was designed to simplify the tax filing process and to provide a tax benefit to taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions. Since its introduction, the Standard Deduction has been adjusted for inflation and is now available to taxpayers of all filing statuses.
===Benefits of Standard Deduction===

The Standard Deduction provides a number of benefits to taxpayers. First, it simplifies the tax filing process by eliminating the need to itemize deductions. This makes it easier for taxpayers to file their taxes and reduces the amount of paperwork that is required. Additionally, the Standard Deduction reduces the amount of taxable income for taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions. This can result in a lower tax bill and more money in the taxpayer’s pocket.
===How to Calculate Standard Deduction===

The amount of the Standard Deduction is determined by the taxpayer’s filing status. For the 2020 tax year, the Standard Deduction amounts are as follows:

• Married Filing Jointly: $24,800

• Head of Household: $18,650

• Married Filing Separately: $12,400

The amount of the Standard Deduction may be reduced if the taxpayer is subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Additionally, taxpayers who are age 65 or older, or who are blind, may be eligible for an additional Standard Deduction.
