===Introduction to Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity===

Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) is a statistical model used to analyze and predict the volatility of [[Financial Market|financial market]]s. It is a type of [[Time Series|time series]] model that is used to capture the volatility of a [[Financial Asset|financial asset]] over time. GARCH models are used to measure the risk associated with a particular asset or portfolio of assets. GARCH models are used by financial analysts and investors to make informed decisions about their investments.
===Definition of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity===

GARCH is a type of time series model that is used to capture the volatility of a financial asset over time. GARCH models are used to measure the risk associated with a particular asset or portfolio of assets. GARCH models are based on the assumption that the volatility of a financial asset is not constant over time, but rather changes over time. GARCH models are used to capture the changing volatility of a financial asset by modeling the variance of the asset's returns as a function of its past returns.
===Applications of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity===

GARCH models are used by financial analysts and investors to make informed decisions about their investments. GARCH models can be used to measure the risk associated with a particular asset or portfolio of assets. GARCH models can also be used to forecast future volatility of a financial asset. GARCH models can also be used to identify potential trading opportunities in the financial markets.
===Limitations of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity===

GARCH models are not perfect and have some limitations. GARCH models are based on the assumption that the volatility of a financial asset is not constant over time, but rather changes over time. This assumption may not always be accurate and can lead to inaccurate predictions. GARCH models also require a large amount of data in order to be effective, which can be difficult to obtain.
===Conclusion===

Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) is a statistical model used to analyze and predict the volatility of financial markets. GARCH models are used by financial analysts and investors to make informed decisions about their investments. GARCH models can be used to measure the risk associated with a particular asset or portfolio of assets and to forecast future volatility of a financial asset. However, GARCH models have some limitations and require a large amount of data in order to be effective
