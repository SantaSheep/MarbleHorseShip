===Introduction to Mortality Tables === 
Mortality tables are a set of statistical tables used to calculate the probability of death for a given population. They are used to calculate life expectancy, mortality rates, and other related statistics. Mortality tables are used by insurance companies, actuaries, and other financial professionals to assess risk and make decisions about life insurance policies, annuities, and other financial products.
===Types of Mortality Tables === 
Mortality tables are divided into two main categories: actual and projected. Actual mortality tables are based on historical data and are used to calculate the probability of death for a given population. Projected mortality tables are based on assumptions about future mortality rates and are used to calculate the probability of death for a given population in the future.
===Uses of Mortality Tables === 
Mortality tables are used to calculate life expectancy, mortality rates, and other related statistics. They are also used to assess risk and make decisions about life insurance policies, annuities, and other financial products.
===Calculating Mortality Rates === 
Mortality rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths in a given population by the total number of people in that population. The resulting number is then multiplied by 1,000 to get the mortality rate per 1,000 people.
===Examples of Mortality Tables === 
Actual mortality tables are based on historical data and are used to calculate the probability of death for a given population. Examples of actual mortality tables include the Human Mortality Database, the U.S. Social Security Administration’s Life Tables, and the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics’ Mortality Tables. Projected mortality tables are based on assumptions about future mortality rates and are used to calculate the probability of death for a given population in the future. Examples of projected mortality tables include the U.S. Social Security Administration’s Period Life Table and the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics’ Projected Mortality Tables.
