===Introduction to Consumer Price Index (CPI) === 
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change in prices over time for a basket of goods and services purchased by consumers. It is used to measure inflation and is one of the most widely used economic indicators. The CPI is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and is released monthly.
===How CPI is Calculated === 
The CPI is calculated by comparing the prices of a fixed basket of goods and services from one period to another. The basket of goods and services is based on the spending patterns of a typical urban consumer. The BLS collects data on the prices of these goods and services from a variety of sources, including retailers, manufacturers, and government agencies. The CPI is then calculated by taking the weighted average of the prices of the goods and services in the basket.
===Uses of CPI === 
The CPI is used to measure inflation and is one of the most widely used economic indicators. It is used by the Federal Reserve to set monetary policy, by the government to adjust Social Security payments, and by businesses to adjust wages and prices. The CPI is also used to adjust tax brackets and other government benefits.
===Factors Affecting CPI === 
The CPI is affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the prices of goods and services, changes in the quality of goods and services, and changes in the composition of the basket of goods and services. In addition, the CPI is affected by changes in the exchange rate, changes in the supply and demand of goods and services, and changes in the cost of production.
===Historical CPI Trends === 
The CPI has been increasing steadily since the early 1980s. In the past decade, the CPI has increased at an average rate of 2.2% per year. This is slightly higher than the average rate of inflation over the past 30 years, which has been around 2.0%.
