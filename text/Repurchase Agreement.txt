===Introduction to Repurchase Agreement===
A repurchase agreement, also known as a repo, is a [[Financial Instrument|financial instrument]] used by banks, corporations, and other [[Financial Institution|financial institution]]s to raise short-term capital. It is a form of secured loan in which one party agrees to sell a security to another party and then repurchase it at a later date at a predetermined price.
