Arbitrage is a financial term that refers to the practice of taking advantage of price discrepancies in different markets to make a profit. It is a form of trading that involves buying and selling assets in different markets to take advantage of price differences. Arbitrage is a popular trading strategy used by investors to capitalize on price discrepancies in different markets.
===Types of Arbitrage===

There are several different types of arbitrage that can be used to make a profit. The most common type of arbitrage is called risk-free arbitrage. This type of arbitrage involves buying and selling the same asset in different markets to take advantage of price discrepancies. Another type of arbitrage is called statistical arbitrage. This type of arbitrage involves taking advantage of price discrepancies between two different assets in the same market. Finally, there is also triangular arbitrage, which involves taking advantage of price discrepancies between three different currencies.
