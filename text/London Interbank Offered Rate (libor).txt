===Introduction to LIBOR - Definition and Overview === 
LIBOR, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, is a benchmark interest rate used to determine the cost of borrowing between banks. It is the most widely used reference rate in the world and is used to set the interest rates on a variety of financial products, including mortgages, credit cards, and other loans. LIBOR is set daily by the British Bankersâ€™ Association (BBA) and is based on the average interest rate that banks charge each other for short-term loans.
===History of LIBOR === 
LIBOR was first introduced in 1986 as a way to measure the cost of borrowing between banks. It was initially used as a reference rate for the London Interbank Market, which is a market for short-term loans between banks. Over time, LIBOR has become the global benchmark for short-term interest rates and is now used to set the interest rates on a variety of financial products.
===How LIBOR is Calculated === 
LIBOR is calculated by the BBA, which surveys a panel of banks each day to determine the average interest rate that banks charge each other for short-term loans. The BBA then publishes the average rate, which is known as the LIBOR rate. The rate is published for seven different currencies and 15 different maturities, ranging from overnight to 12 months.
===Impact of LIBOR on Financial Markets === 
LIBOR has a significant impact on the global financial markets. It is used to set the interest rates on a variety of financial products, including mortgages, credit cards, and other loans. It is also used as a reference rate for a variety of derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and futures contracts. As a result, changes in LIBOR can have a significant impact on the cost of borrowing and the value of financial products.
===Recent Developments in LIBOR === 
In recent years, LIBOR has come under increased scrutiny due to allegations of manipulation by banks. In response, the BBA has implemented a number of reforms to improve the accuracy and transparency of the rate. In addition, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a new benchmark rate, known as the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA), which is expected to replace LIBOR in 2021.
