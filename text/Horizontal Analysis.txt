===Introduction to Horizontal Analysis === 
Horizontal analysis is a financial statement analysis technique that is used to compare line items in financial statements over a period of time. It is also known as trend analysis or trend study. This type of analysis is used to identify trends in a company’s financial performance and to compare the performance of a company to its competitors. It is a useful tool for investors and analysts to assess the financial health of a company.
===Benefits of Horizontal Analysis === 
Horizontal analysis is a powerful tool for financial statement analysis. It can be used to identify trends in a company’s financial performance over time. It can also be used to compare the performance of a company to its competitors. This type of analysis can help investors and analysts to make informed decisions about investing in a company.
===How to Perform Horizontal Analysis === 
Horizontal analysis is a relatively simple process. The first step is to identify the financial statements that need to be analyzed. This could include the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The next step is to identify the line items that need to be analyzed. This could include revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and equity. The third step is to calculate the percentage change in each line item over the period of time being analyzed. This can be done by dividing the current period’s line item by the prior period’s line item and then subtracting one from the other.
===Example of Horizontal Analysis === 
Let’s say that you are analyzing the financial statements of a company for the past two years. The income statement for the current year shows total revenue of $100,000 and total expenses of $90,000. The income statement for the prior year shows total revenue of $90,000 and total expenses of $80,000. To calculate the percentage change in total revenue, you would divide the current year’s total revenue ($100,000) by the prior year’s total revenue ($90,000) and then subtract one from the other. This would give you a percentage change in total revenue of 11.1%. To calculate the percentage change in total expenses, you would divide the current year’s total expenses ($90,000) by the prior year’s total expenses ($80,000) and then subtract one from the other. This would give you a percentage change in total expenses of 12.5%.
===Limitations of Horizontal Analysis === 
Horizontal analysis is a useful tool for financial statement analysis, but it does have some limitations. One limitation is that it does not take into account the effects of inflation. Another limitation is that it does not take into account changes in the size of the company. For example, if a company has grown significantly over the period of time being analyzed, the percentage changes in the financial statements may not be meaningful.
===Conclusion=== 
Horizontal analysis is a powerful tool for financial statement analysis. It can be used to identify trends in a company’s financial performance over time and to compare the performance of a company to its competitors. However, it does have some limitations, such as not taking into account the effects of inflation and changes in the size of the company. Despite these limitations, horizontal analysis is still a useful tool for investors and analysts to assess the financial health of a company.
