===Introduction to Contributed Capital===

Contributed capital is a type of capital that is provided to a business by its owners or shareholders. It is also known as equity capital or owner’s equity. It is the money that is invested in the business by the owners or shareholders in exchange for a share of ownership in the business. It is the opposite of borrowed capital, which is money that is borrowed from a lender and must be repaid with interest. Contributed capital is an important source of capital for businesses, as it provides them with the funds they need to grow and expand.
===Types of Contributed Capital===

Contributed capital can come in a variety of forms. Common types of contributed capital include cash, common stock, [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], and [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]]. Cash is the most common form of contributed capital, as it is the easiest to obtain and the most liquid. Common stock is a type of stock that is issued to shareholders and gives them voting rights in the company. Preferred stock is a type of stock that gives shareholders a higher claim on the company’s assets and earnings than common stock. Retained earnings are the profits that a company has earned but has not yet distributed to its shareholders.
===Accounting for Contributed Capital===

Contributed capital is recorded on the [[Balance Sheet|balance sheet]] as a liability. This is because it represents the money that the owners or shareholders have invested in the business and is not a debt that must be repaid. The amount of contributed capital is calculated by subtracting the [[Total Liabilities|total liabilities]] from the total assets. This amount is then divided by the number of shares outstanding to determine the [[Book Value|book value]] per share.

It also allows the owners or shareholders to maintain control of the business, as they are the ones who have invested in it. Additionally, contributed capital does not have to be repaid, so it does not create any additional financial obligations for the business.
===Disadvantages of Contributed Capital===

Additionally, contributed capital does not provide the business with any tax benefits, as it is not a deductible expense. Finally, contributed capital can be difficult to value, as it is not a [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]].
