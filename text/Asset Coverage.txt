===Introduction to Assetcoverage===
Assetcoverage is a financial term that refers to the amount of assets a company has relative to its liabilities. It is a measure of a company's financial health and is used to assess the risk of a company defaulting on its debt. Assetcoverage is an important concept for investors and creditors alike, as it provides an indication of the company's ability to meet its financial obligations.
===Definition of Assetcoverage===
Assetcoverage is a measure of a company's financial health and is calculated by dividing the total assets of a company by its [[Total Liabilities|total liabilities]]. The higher the assetcoverage ratio, the better the company's financial position. A ratio of 1.0 or higher indicates that the company has sufficient assets to cover its liabilities. A ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that the company does not have enough assets to cover its liabilities.
===Types of Assetcoverage===
There are two main types of assetcoverage: current assetcoverage and total assetcoverage. Current assetcoverage is calculated by dividing the [[Current Assets|current assets]] of a company by its [[Current Liabilities|current liabilities]]. Total assetcoverage is calculated by dividing the total assets of a company by its total liabilities.

===Risks of Assetcoverage===
Although assetcoverage is an important measure of a company's financial health, it is not a perfect measure. A high assetcoverage ratio does not guarantee that the company will not default on its debt. A company may have a high assetcoverage ratio but still be at risk of defaulting on its debt due to other factors such as poor management or a weak economy.
