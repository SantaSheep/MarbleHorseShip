===Introduction to Asset Classes===

Asset classes are a broad category of investments that are used to diversify a portfolio. Asset classes are typically divided into three main categories: stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents. Each asset class has its own unique characteristics and risks, and investors should understand the differences between them before investing. Asset classes can be further divided into sub-categories, such as large-cap stocks, small-cap stocks, government bonds, corporate bonds, and [[Money Market|money market]] instruments.
===Types of Asset Classes===

Stocks are one of the most common asset classes. Stocks represent ownership in a company and can be bought and sold on the [[Stock Market|stock market]]. Stocks can be divided into two main categories: large-cap stocks and small-cap stocks. Large-cap stocks are stocks of companies with a [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] of more than $10 billion, while small-cap stocks are stocks of companies with a market capitalization of less than $2 billion.

Bonds are another common asset class. Bonds are [[Debt Instrument|debt instrument]]s issued by governments and corporations. Government bonds are issued by governments to finance their operations, while corporate bonds are issued by corporations to finance their operations. Bonds typically pay a fixed rate of interest over a specified period of time.

Cash equivalents are short-term investments that can be quickly converted into cash. Examples of cash equivalents include money market instruments, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), [[Treasury Bill|treasury bill]]s, and [[Commercial Paper|commercial paper]].
===Benefits of Asset Classes===

Asset classes provide investors with diversification benefits. By investing in different asset classes, investors can reduce their risk of loss due to market volatility. Diversification also allows investors to spread their investments across different sectors and industries, which can help to reduce the risk of loss due to sector-specific events.

Asset classes also provide investors with the opportunity to earn higher returns. By investing in different asset classes, investors can take advantage of different market conditions and earn higher returns than if they were to invest in a single asset class.
===Risks of Asset Classes===

Investing in asset classes carries certain risks. The most common risk is market risk, which is the risk of loss due to market volatility. Market risk can be reduced by diversifying investments across different asset classes.

In addition, investing in asset classes carries the risk of inflation. Inflation is the general increase in prices over time, which can erode the value of investments. Investors should be aware of the potential for inflation and take steps to protect their investments from its effects.
