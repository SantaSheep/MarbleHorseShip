===Introduction to Murabaha===
Murabaha is a type of Islamic financing that is used to purchase goods and services. It is a contract between two parties, a buyer and a seller, in which the seller agrees to sell a specific item to the buyer at a predetermined price. The buyer then pays the seller in installments over a period of time. Murabaha is a popular form of financing in the Islamic world, as it is compliant with Islamic law and is seen as a more ethical form of financing than traditional forms of financing.
===Types of Murabaha===
There are two main types of Murabaha: deferred payment Murabaha and spot Murabaha.
