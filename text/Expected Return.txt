===Introduction to Expected Return === 
Expected return is a concept used in finance to measure the expected gain or loss of an investment over a certain period of time. It is a measure of the average return that an investor can expect to receive from a particular investment. The expected return is calculated by taking into account the probability of each possible outcome and multiplying it by the expected return of that outcome.
===Calculating Expected Return === 
The expected return of an investment is calculated by taking the sum of all possible outcomes and multiplying them by their respective probabilities. For example, if an investor is considering investing in a stock, they would need to consider the probability of the stock going up, the probability of the stock going down, and the probability of the stock staying the same. The expected return of the stock would then be calculated by multiplying each of these probabilities by the expected return of each outcome.
===Factors Affecting Expected Return === 
There are several factors that can affect the expected return of an investment. These include the risk associated with the investment, the time horizon of the investment, the liquidity of the investment, and the cost of the investment. The risk associated with an investment is the amount of uncertainty associated with the potential return of the investment. The time horizon of the investment is the length of time that the investor expects to hold the investment. The liquidity of the investment is the ease with which the investor can convert the investment into cash. The cost of the investment is the amount of money that the investor must pay to purchase the investment.
===Examples of Expected Return === 
One example of expected return is the expected return of a stock. The expected return of a stock is the expected return of the stock over a certain period of time. This expected return is calculated by taking into account the probability of the stock going up, the probability of the stock going down, and the probability of the stock staying the same.
