===Introduction to Spinoffs === 
A spinoff is a type of corporate restructuring in which a company creates a new business entity by transferring a portion of its existing assets and liabilities to the new entity. This process is also known as a corporate spinoff, demerger, or divestiture. Spinoffs are typically used to separate a company’s core business from its non-core operations, allowing the company to focus on its core business and allowing the new entity to pursue its own growth opportunities.
===Types of Spinoffs === 
There are two main types of spinoffs: partial spinoffs and full spinoffs. In a partial spinoff, a company transfers a portion of its assets and liabilities to a new entity, but retains a controlling interest in the new entity. In a full spinoff, the company transfers all of its assets and liabilities to the new entity and relinquishes all control.
