===Introduction to Leverage Ratio===
The leverage ratio is a financial metric used to measure the amount of debt a company has relative to its equity. It is a measure of a company’s [[Financial Risk|financial risk]] and is used to assess the company’s ability to meet its financial obligations. The leverage ratio is an important tool for investors and creditors to assess the financial health of a company.
===Types of Leverage Ratios===
There are several different types of leverage ratios that can be used to measure a company’s financial risk. The most common leverage ratios are the debt-to-equity ratio, the debt-to-assets ratio, and the [[Interest Coverage Ratio|interest coverage ratio]]. The debt-to-equity ratio measures the amount of debt a company has relative to its equity. The debt-to-assets ratio measures the amount of debt a company has relative to its total assets. The interest coverage ratio measures the ability of a company to meet its interest payments.
===Calculating Leverage Ratios===
The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing the total amount of debt by the total amount of equity. For example, if a company has $100,000 in debt and $200,000 in equity, the leverage ratio would be 0.5. This means that the company has $0.50 of debt for every $1.00 of equity.
