===Introduction to Overhead===

Overhead is a term used to describe the costs associated with running a business that are not directly related to the production of goods or services. These costs include rent, utilities, insurance, taxes, and other administrative costs. Overhead is an important part of any business’s budget and can have a significant impact on the profitability of the business.
===Types of Overhead===

Overhead can be divided into two main categories: fixed and variable. Fixed overhead costs are those that remain the same regardless of the level of production or sales. Examples of fixed overhead costs include rent, insurance, and taxes. [[Variable Overhead|Variable overhead]] costs, on the other hand, are those that vary depending on the level of production or sales. Examples of variable overhead costs include materials, labor, and shipping.

Calculating overhead costs can be a complex process. Generally, overhead costs are calculated as a percentage of total sales or production. This percentage is then multiplied by the total sales or production to determine the total overhead cost. For example, if a business has total sales of $100,000 and an overhead cost of 10%, the total overhead cost would be $10,000.
