It is one of the most widely used indicators in the world of technical analysis and is used by traders to identify potential buy and sell signals. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. The result is then plotted against a 9-day EMA of the MACD line, which is called the signal line. The MACD line is used to identify potential buy and sell signals, while the signal line is used to confirm these signals.
