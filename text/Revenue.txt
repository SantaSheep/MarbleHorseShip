===Introduction to Revenue === 
Revenue is the income generated from the sale of goods or services, or any other use of capital or assets, associated with the main operations of an organization before any costs or expenses are deducted. Revenue is also referred to as sales or turnover. It is the top line or gross income figure from which costs are subtracted to determine net income.
===Types of Revenue === 
Revenue can be classified into two main categories: operating revenue and non-operating revenue. Operating revenue is generated from the main operations of a business, such as the sale of goods or services. Non-operating revenue is generated from activities that are not related to the main operations of a business, such as the sale of investments or the receipt of interest income.
===Calculating Revenue === 
Revenue is calculated by multiplying the price of a product or service by the number of units sold. For example, if a company sells 100 units of a product at a price of $10 each, the total revenue would be $1,000.
===Revenue Recognition === 
Revenue recognition is the process of recognizing revenue when it is earned. This is done by matching the revenue to the costs associated with generating the revenue. For example, if a company sells 100 units of a product at a price of $10 each, the revenue should be recognized when the product is delivered to the customer.
===Revenue Streams === 
Revenue streams are the sources of revenue that a business uses to generate income. Common revenue streams include sales of goods or services, advertising, subscriptions, and fees.
