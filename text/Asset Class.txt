===Introduction to Asset Classes === 
Asset classes are categories of investments that have similar characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace. They are typically divided into three main categories: stocks, bonds, and cash. Each asset class has its own unique risk and return characteristics, and investors can use them to diversify their portfolios and reduce risk.
===Types of Asset Classes === 
Stocks: Stocks are shares of ownership in a company. They represent a claim on the companyâ€™s assets and earnings. When you buy a stock, you become a partial owner of the company and are entitled to a portion of its profits.

Real Estate: Real estate is a tangible asset class that includes residential and commercial properties. Real estate investments can provide steady income and appreciation potential, but they also come with higher risks and costs.
===Cash === 
Diversification: Investing in multiple asset classes can help reduce risk by spreading out your investments across different types of investments. This can help protect your portfolio from market volatility and reduce the impact of any single investment.
