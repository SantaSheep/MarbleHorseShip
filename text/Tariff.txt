===Introduction to Tariff===

A tariff is a tax imposed by a government on imported goods and services. Tariffs are used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, to raise revenue for the government, and to influence the [[Terms Of Trade|terms of trade]] between countries. Tariffs can be imposed on a wide range of goods and services, including [[Raw Materials|raw materials]], manufactured goods, and services. Tariffs can be imposed on imports from any country, or on imports from specific countries. Tariffs can also be imposed on exports to certain countries.
===Types of Tariffs===

There are several types of tariffs that can be imposed. Ad valorem tariffs are taxes imposed on imports based on the value of the goods or services being imported. Specific tariffs are taxes imposed on imports based on the quantity of the goods or services being imported. Compound tariffs are taxes imposed on imports based on both the value and the quantity of the goods or services being imported. Tariffs can also be imposed on exports, in which case they are known as export tariffs.
