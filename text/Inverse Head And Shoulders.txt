===Introduction to Inverse Head and Shoulders===

It is a chart pattern that is formed when the price of a security makes a series of lower lows and higher highs.

The inverse head and shoulders pattern is made up of three consecutive troughs and peaks. The first trough is the left shoulder, the second trough is the head, and the third trough is the right shoulder. The left shoulder is the lowest point of the pattern, followed by the head, which is the highest point. The right shoulder is the second lowest point of the pattern.

When the price of the security breaks above the neckline, it is a signal that the downtrend may be coming to an end and that the price of the security may be about to reverse and start to move higher.
