===Introduction to Breakeven Analysis===

Breakeven analysis is a financial tool used to determine the point at which a business’s total revenue is equal to its total costs. This point is known as the breakeven point, and it is used to determine the profitability of a business. Breakeven analysis is used to determine the minimum amount of sales that must be achieved in order for a business to remain profitable. It is also used to determine the optimal pricing strategy for a product or service.
===Breakeven Point Calculation===

The breakeven point is calculated by subtracting the total [[Fixed Cost|fixed cost]]s from the total [[Variable Cost|variable cost]]s. The resulting number is then divided by the contribution margin per unit. The contribution margin per unit is the difference between the selling price of a product or service and the variable costs associated with producing it. The resulting number is the breakeven point, which is the number of units that must be sold in order for the business to break even.
===Breakeven Analysis in Practice===

Breakeven analysis is used to determine the optimal pricing strategy for a product or service. By calculating the breakeven point, a business can determine the minimum amount of sales that must be achieved in order for the business to remain profitable. This information can then be used to set the optimal price for a product or service.

Additionally, breakeven analysis does not take into account the potential for increased sales due to marketing or other promotional activities.
