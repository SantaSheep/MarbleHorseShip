===Definition of Qip===
Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) is a process used by Indian companies to raise capital from the public. It is a method of raising funds from the public by issuing equity shares, debentures, or any other securities. The process involves the company issuing a prospectus to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) such as banks, [[Mutual Fund|mutual fund]]s, insurance companies, and [[Venture Capital|venture capital]] funds. The QIBs then decide whether to invest in the company or not.
===History of Qip===
QIP was introduced in India in 2006 by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The purpose of introducing QIP was to provide an alternative source of capital to companies that are not listed on the stock exchange. Since its introduction, QIP has become a popular way for companies to raise capital. It has been used by many companies to raise funds for expansion, acquisitions, and other corporate activities.
===Types of Qip===
There are two types of QIPs: open-ended and closed-ended. In an open-ended QIP, the company can issue new shares to the public at any time. In a closed-ended QIP, the company can issue new shares only at the time of the initial offering.
===Benefits of Qip===

===Risks of Qip===
Although QIP is a cost-effective way to raise capital, it does come with some risks. The company may not be able to raise the desired amount of capital, as the QIBs may not be willing to invest in the company.
