===Introduction to Cash Ratio===

The Cash Ratio is a financial metric used to measure a company’s liquidity. It is calculated by dividing a company’s total [[Cash And Cash Equivalents|cash and cash equivalents]] by its [[Current Liabilities|current liabilities]]. The Cash Ratio is a more conservative measure of liquidity than the [[Current Ratio|Current Ratio]], as it only takes into account the most [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]]s of a company. It is a useful tool for investors and creditors to assess a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations.
===Calculation of Cash Ratio===

The Cash Ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s total cash and cash equivalents by its current liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, checking accounts, [[[[Money Market|Money Market]] Account|money marke[[T Account|t account]]]]s, and short-term investments. Current liabilities are those obligations that must be paid within one year, such as [[Accounts Payable|accounts payable]], taxes, and short-term debt.

The formula for the Cash Ratio is:

Cash Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities
===Significance of Cash Ratio===

The Cash Ratio is a useful tool for investors and creditors to assess a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations. A high Cash Ratio indicates that a company has sufficient liquidity to meet its short-term obligations. A low Cash Ratio indicates that a company may not have enough liquidity to meet its short-term obligations.

The Cash Ratio is also a useful tool for comparing the liquidity of different companies. A higher Cash Ratio indicates that a company is more liquid than a company with a lower Cash Ratio.

The Cash Ratio is a useful tool for assessing a company’s liquidity, but it has some limitations. The Cash Ratio does not take into account a company’s long-term assets or liabilities. It also does not take into account a company’s ability to generate cash from its operations.
