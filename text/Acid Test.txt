===Introduction to Acidtest===
The Acidtest is a financial ratio used to measure the liquidity of a company. It is also known as the [[Quick Ratio|quick ratio]] or the acid-test ratio. The Acidtest is used to measure a company’s ability to pay its short-term liabilities with its most [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]]s. It is a more stringent measure of liquidity than the [[Current Ratio|current ratio]], which measures a company’s ability to pay its [[Current Liabilities|current liabilities]] with its [[Current Assets|current assets]].
===Definition of Acidtest===
The Acidtest is calculated by dividing a company’s most liquid assets by its current liabilities. Most liquid assets are defined as cash, [[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]], and [[Accounts Receivable|accounts receivable]]. Current liabilities are defined as short-term debt and other obligations that must be paid within one year. The Acidtest is expressed as a ratio, with a higher ratio indicating a higher level of liquidity.
===Uses of Acidtest===
The Acidtest is used by investors and creditors to assess a company’s ability to pay its short-term liabilities. It is also used by analysts to compare the liquidity of different companies. A higher Acidtest ratio indicates that a company is more liquid and is better able to pay its short-term liabilities.
