===Introduction to Bearhug===
A bearhug is a type of [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]] bid in which a company offers to purchase another company for a premium price. The offer is usually made in the form of a tender offer, which is an offer to purchase a certain number of shares of the target company at a premium price. The offer is usually made in an effort to acquire the target company without having to go through the lengthy and expensive process of a traditional merger or acquisition. The term “bearhug” is derived from the idea that the offer is so attractive that the target company is “hugged” into accepting it.
===History of Bearhug===
The concept of a bearhug takeover bid has been around since the early 1980s. The first bearhug takeover bid was made by the American conglomerate ITT Corporation in 1982. ITT offered to purchase the shares of the Hartford Insurance Company for a premium price of $1.2 billion. The offer was accepted and the deal was completed in 1983. Since then, bearhug takeover bids have become a popular way for companies to acquire other companies without having to go through the lengthy and expensive process of a traditional merger or acquisition.
===Types of Bearhug===
There are two main types of bearhug takeover bids: cash offers and stock offers. In a cash offer, the bidder offers to purchase the target company’s shares for a premium price in cash. In a stock offer, the bidder offers to purchase the target company’s shares for a premium price in the bidder’s own stock. Both types of offers are usually made in the form of a tender offer, which is an offer to purchase a certain number of shares of the target company at a premium price.

Additionally, the premium price offered in a bearhug takeover bid is usually attractive to the target company’s shareholders, as it is often higher than the current market price of the target company’s shares.
===Risks of Bearhug===
The primary risk of a bearhug takeover bid is that the bidder may not be able to complete the transaction due to regulatory or other issues. Additionally, the premium price offered in a bearhug takeover bid may not be attractive enough to the target company’s shareholders, which could lead to the deal not being completed. Finally, the bidder may not be able to finance the transaction, which could also lead to the deal not being completed.
