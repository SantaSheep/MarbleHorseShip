===Introduction to Derivatives===

Derivatives are [[Financial Instrument|financial instrument]]s whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset. They are used to hedge against risk, speculate on price movements, and to generate income. Derivatives can be used to manage risk in a portfolio, as well as to increase returns. Derivatives are used by a wide range of investors, from large institutional investors to individual traders.
===Types of Derivatives===

There are several types of derivatives, including futures, options, swaps, and forwards. Futures are contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase an asset at a predetermined price at a future date. Options are contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price. Swaps are agreements between two parties to exchange [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]s based on the performance of an underlying asset. Forwards are contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase an asset at a predetermined price at a future date.
===Derivative Pricing===

The price of a derivative is determined by the underlying asset’s price, the time to expiration, and the volatility of the underlying asset. The price of a derivative is also affected by the supply and demand of the underlying asset. The price of a derivative is also affected by the creditworthiness of the parties involved in the transaction.
===Derivative Markets===

Derivatives are traded on exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC), and through electronic trading platforms. Exchanges are regulated markets where derivatives are traded in a standardized format. OTC markets are less regulated and involve more customized contracts. Electronic trading platforms are computer-based systems that allow traders to buy and sell derivatives in real-time.
===Derivative Strategies===

Derivatives can be used in a variety of strategies, including hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. Hedging is the use of derivatives to reduce the risk of an investment. Speculation is the use of derivatives to take advantage of price movements. Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of derivatives to take advantage of price discrepancies.
===Derivative Risks===

Derivatives can be risky investments. The most common risks associated with derivatives are counterparty risk, [[Liquidity Risk|liquidity risk]], and market risk. Counterparty risk is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill their obligations. Liquidity risk is the risk that the derivative cannot be sold or bought at a reasonable price. Market risk is the risk that the underlying asset will move in an unexpected direction.
