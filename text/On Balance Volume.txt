===Introduction to Onbalancevolume===

Onbalancevolume (OBV) is a [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] indicator used to measure the flow of money into and out of a security. It is based on the idea that the volume of a security is an indicator of the strength of the current trend. OBV is calculated by adding the volume of a security on up days and subtracting the volume on down days. The resulting total is then plotted on a chart to show the trend of the security.
===History of Onbalancevolume===

Onbalancevolume was developed by Joe Granville in the 1960s. Granville was a pioneer in the field of technical analysis and was the first to recognize the importance of volume in the [[Stock Market|stock market]]. He believed that volume was a key indicator of the strength of a trend and that it could be used to predict future price movements.
===Calculating Onbalancevolume===

Onbalancevolume is calculated by adding the volume of a security on up days and subtracting the volume on down days. The resulting total is then plotted on a chart to show the trend of the security. The OBV line is calculated by taking the current day's volume and adding it to the previous day's OBV total. If the security's price is up, the current day's volume is added to the previous day's OBV total. If the security's price is down, the current day's volume is subtracted from the previous day's OBV total.
===Uses of Onbalancevolume===

Onbalancevolume is used to measure the flow of money into and out of a security. It is used to identify potential buying and selling opportunities and to confirm the strength of a trend. It can also be used to identify divergences between price and volume, which can be used to anticipate a reversal in the trend.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of Onbalancevolume===

Onbalancevolume is a simple and effective indicator that can be used to identify potential buying and selling opportunities. It is also easy to interpret and can be used to confirm the strength of a trend. However, it is important to note that OBV is a lagging indicator and may not be able to predict future price movements.

It is based on the idea that the volume of a security is an indicator of the strength of the current trend. OBV is calculated by adding the volume of a security on up days and subtracting the volume on down days.
