===Introduction to S Corporation (S Subchapter) === 
An S Corporation, also known as an S Subchapter, is a type of business entity that is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is a pass-through entity, meaning that the profits and losses of the business are passed through to the owners, who then report them on their individual tax returns. This type of business structure is popular among small business owners because it offers certain tax advantages.
===Advantages of S Corporation === 
The primary advantage of an S Corporation is that it allows business owners to avoid double taxation. With a traditional C Corporation, the business itself is taxed on its profits, and then the owners are taxed on their dividends. With an S Corporation, the profits and losses are passed through to the owners, who then report them on their individual tax returns. This means that the business itself is not taxed, and the owners are only taxed on their individual income.
