===Introduction to Sampling Errors === 

===Types of Sampling Errors === 
Examples of Sampling Errors: Some examples of sampling errors include selection bias, non-response bias, and measurement errors. Selection bias occurs when the sample is not randomly selected, resulting in a sample that is not representative of the population. Non-response bias occurs when certain members of the population are not included in the sample, resulting in a sample that is not representative of the population. Measurement errors occur when the data is not accurately measured, resulting in inaccurate conclusions.
