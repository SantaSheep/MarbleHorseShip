===Introduction to Poisonpill===
A poison pill is a type of defensive tactic used by companies to prevent [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]]s. It is a strategy that is designed to make a company less attractive to potential acquirers by making it more expensive to acquire. The poison pill strategy is typically implemented by issuing additional shares of the company’s stock to existing shareholders at a discounted price. This makes it more expensive for a potential acquirer to purchase a controlling stake in the company. The poison pill strategy is also known as a shareholder rights plan.
===Types of Poisonpill===
There are two main types of poison pills: the flip-in and the flip-over. The flip-in poison pill is triggered when an outside investor acquires a certain percentage of the company’s stock. When this happens, existing shareholders are given the right to purchase additional shares of the company’s stock at a discounted price. This makes it more expensive for the outside investor to acquire a controlling stake in the company. The flip-over poison pill is triggered when an outside investor acquires a certain percentage of the company’s stock and then attempts to acquire the rest of the company. When this happens, existing shareholders are given the right to purchase additional shares of the company’s stock at a discounted price. This makes it more expensive for the outside investor to acquire a controlling stake in the company.
===Benefits of Poisonpill===
The primary benefit of the poison pill strategy is that it gives existing shareholders the ability to protect their investments from hostile takeovers. By making it more expensive for a potential acquirer to purchase a controlling stake in the company, the poison pill strategy can help to deter hostile takeovers. Additionally, the poison pill strategy can help to protect the company’s assets and preserve its independence.
===Drawbacks of Poisonpill===
The primary drawback of the poison pill strategy is that it can be expensive for the company to implement. Additionally, the poison pill strategy can be seen as a sign of weakness by potential acquirers, which can make the company less attractive to potential investors. Finally, the poison pill strategy can be seen as a form of entrenchment, which can make it difficult for the company to attract new investors.
