===Introduction to Organizational Behavior===

Organizational behavior is the study of how individuals and groups interact within an organization. It is a field of study that examines the behavior of people in organizations and how their behavior affects the organization’s performance. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws on theories and concepts from psychology, sociology, economics, and other disciplines. The goal of organizational behavior is to understand and predict how people will behave in an organization and how their behavior will affect the organization’s performance.
===Theories of Organizational Behavior===

Organizational behavior is based on a number of theories that attempt to explain how people behave in organizations. These theories include the Hawthorne effect, the theory of planned behavior, the expectancy theory, the equity theory, and the social exchange theory. Each of these theories has its own set of assumptions and implications for how people behave in organizations.

The Hawthorne effect is based on the idea that people’s behavior is affected by the environment in which they work. This theory suggests that people’s behavior is influenced by the physical environment, the social environment, and the organizational culture. The theory of planned behavior suggests that people’s behavior is determined by their intentions and beliefs. The expectancy theory suggests that people’s behavior is determined by their expectations of rewards and punishments. The equity theory suggests that people’s behavior is determined by their perception of fairness in the workplace. Finally, the social exchange theory suggests that people’s behavior is determined by their relationships with others in the organization.
