===Introduction to Interest Coverage Ratio===

Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) is a financial ratio that measures a company’s ability to pay its [[Interest Expense|interest expense]]s on its outstanding debt. It is calculated by dividing a company’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expenses for a given period. The higher the ratio, the more capable a company is of paying its interest expenses. ICR is an important measure of a company’s financial health and is used by investors and creditors to assess the risk of lending money to a company.
===Calculation of Interest Coverage Ratio===

The formula for calculating ICR is as follows:

ICR = EBIT / Interest Expense

Where EBIT is the company’s earnings before interest and taxes, and Interest Expense is the amount of interest paid by the company during the period.
===Significance of Interest Coverage Ratio===

The ICR is an important measure of a company’s financial health and is used by investors and creditors to assess the risk of lending money to a company. A high ICR indicates that a company is able to easily pay its interest expenses and is in a strong financial position. A low ICR, on the other hand, indicates that a company may not be able to pay its interest expenses and is in a weak financial position.
===Limitations of Interest Coverage Ratio===

Although ICR is a useful measure of a company’s financial health, it has some limitations. For example, ICR does not take into account the company’s ability to pay its principal debt, which is an important factor in assessing a company’s financial health. Additionally, ICR does not take into account the company’s future earnings, which may be affected by changes in the economy or other factors.
===Conclusion===
