It is a business model that has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many major fashion retailers adopting it.

It is a form of mass production that allows retailers to quickly respond to changing trends and consumer demand.

Consumers are encouraged to buy more and more clothing, often without considering the environmental and social impacts of their purchases. Additionally, the low quality of fast fashion clothing means that it often does not last very long, leading to more frequent purchases.
