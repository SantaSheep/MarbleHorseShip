===Introduction to Coefficient of Determination===

The coefficient of determination, also known as the R-squared value, is a statistical measure that is used to assess the goodness of fit of a regression model. It is a measure of how well the model fits the data, and is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The coefficient of determination is a number between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit and 0 indicating no fit at all. The coefficient of determination is an important tool for assessing the accuracy of a regression model and can be used to compare different models.
===Definition of Coefficient of Determination===

The coefficient of determination is a measure of how well a regression model fits the data. It is calculated by taking the ratio of the explained variance of the model to the total variance of the data. The coefficient of determination is a number between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit and 0 indicating no fit at all. The coefficient of determination is also known as the R-squared value.
===Uses of Coefficient of Determination===

The coefficient of determination is used to assess the accuracy of a regression model. It is used to compare different models and to determine which model is the best fit for the data. The coefficient of determination can also be used to determine the strength of the relationship between two variables.
===Calculating Coefficient of Determination===

The coefficient of determination is calculated by taking the ratio of the explained variance of the model to the total variance of the data. The explained variance is the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values. The total variance is the sum of the squared differences between the mean of the data and the actual values. The coefficient of determination is then calculated by dividing the explained variance by the total variance.
===Examples of Coefficient of Determination===

The coefficient of determination can be used to compare different regression models. For example, if two models are being compared, the model with the higher coefficient of determination is the better fit for the data. The coefficient of determination can also be used to determine the strength of the relationship between two variables. For example, if the coefficient of determination is 0.8, then there is a strong relationship between the two variables.
===Limitations of Coefficient of Determination===

The coefficient of determination is a useful tool for assessing the accuracy of a regression model, but it has some limitations. The coefficient of determination does not take into account the underlying assumptions of the model, such as the linearity of the data. Additionally, the coefficient of determination does not take into account the presence of outliers or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model.

The coefficient of determination is a statistical measure that is used to asses
