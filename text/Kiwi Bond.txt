===Introduction to Kiwi Bonds===
Kiwi bonds are a type of debt security issued by the New Zealand government. They are denominated in New Zealand dollars and are issued in both fixed and floating rate formats. The bonds are issued by the New Zealand Debt Management Office (NZDMO) and are available to both domestic and international investors. The bonds are typically issued with maturities of up to 10 years and are backed by the full faith and credit of the New Zealand government.
===History of Kiwi Bonds===
Kiwi bonds were first introduced in 1989 as a way for the New Zealand government to raise funds for its various projects. Since then, the bonds have become an important source of funding for the government. The bonds are also popular with investors due to their low risk and attractive yields.
===Types of Kiwi Bonds===
Kiwi bonds come in two main types: fixed rate and floating rate. Fixed rate bonds have a fixed coupon rate that does not change over the life of the bond. Floating rate bonds have a coupon rate that is adjusted periodically based on market conditions.

Kiwi bonds offer a number of advantages to investors. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the New Zealand government, making them a relatively safe investment. They also offer attractive yields, with yields typically higher than those offered by other government bonds.
