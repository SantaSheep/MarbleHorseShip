===Introduction to Floor Area Ratio===

Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is a term used in urban planning and zoning to describe the ratio of a building’s total floor area to the size of the land on which it is built. It is used to regulate the size and density of buildings in a given area, and is an important tool for urban planners and developers. FAR is typically expressed as a decimal or percentage, and is used to determine the maximum allowable size of a building in a given area.
===Definition of Floor Area Ratio===

Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is defined as the ratio of a building’s total floor area to the size of the land on which it is built. It is typically expressed as a decimal or percentage, and is used to determine the maximum allowable size of a building in a given area. FAR is used to regulate the size and density of buildings in a given area, and is an important tool for urban planners and developers.
===Uses of Floor Area Ratio===

Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is used to regulate the size and density of buildings in a given area. It is used to ensure that buildings are not too large or too dense for the area in which they are built. FAR is also used to ensure that buildings are not too small or too sparse for the area in which they are built. FAR is an important tool for urban planners and developers, as it helps to ensure that buildings are built in a way that is compatible with the surrounding area.
===Calculating Floor Area Ratio===

Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is calculated by dividing the total floor area of a building by the size of the land on which it is built. The resulting number is then expressed as a decimal or percentage. For example, if a building has a total floor area of 10,000 square feet and is built on a lot that is 1 acre in size, the FAR would be 10,000/43,560 = 0.23 or 23%.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of Floor Area Ratio===

Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is an important tool for urban planners and developers, as it helps to ensure that buildings are built in a way that is compatible with the surrounding area. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages to using FAR.

Advantages:

• FAR helps to ensure that buildings are not too large or too dense for the area in which they are built.

• FAR helps to ensure that buildings are not too small or too sparse for the area in which they are built.

• FAR helps to ensure that buildings are built in a way that is compatible with the surrounding area.

Disadvantages:

• FAR can be difficult to calculate, as it requires knowledge of the total floor area of a building and the size of the land on which it is built.

• FAR can be difficult to enforce, as it requires constant monitoring of buildings in a given area.

• FAR can be restrictive, as it limits the size and density of buildings in a given area.
===Conclusion===

Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is an important tool for urban planners and developers, as it helps to ensure that buildings are built in a way that is compatible with the
