===Introduction to Common Size Financial Statements === 
Common size financial statements are financial statements that present the relative size of different accounts on a company’s balance sheet and income statement. This type of financial statement is useful for comparing the financial performance of a company over time or to other companies in the same industry. Common size financial statements are expressed as a percentage of total assets or total sales.
===Benefits of Common Size Financial Statements === 
Common size financial statements provide a more accurate comparison of a company’s financial performance over time or to other companies in the same industry. This type of financial statement allows investors and analysts to quickly identify trends in a company’s financial performance. Common size financial statements also provide a more comprehensive view of a company’s financial position by providing a breakdown of the relative size of each account on the balance sheet and income statement.
===How to Calculate Common Size Financial Statements === 
To calculate common size financial statements, the total assets or total sales of a company must first be determined. Once the total assets or total sales have been determined, each account on the balance sheet and income statement can be expressed as a percentage of the total assets or total sales. For example, if a company has total assets of $100,000 and accounts receivable of $10,000, then accounts receivable would be expressed as 10% of total assets.
===Examples of Common Size Financial Statements === 
Common size financial statements can be used to compare the financial performance of a company over time or to other companies in the same industry. For example, a common size income statement can be used to compare the relative size of different revenue and expense accounts over time. A common size balance sheet can be used to compare the relative size of different asset and liability accounts over time.
===Limitations of Common Size Financial Statements === 
Common size financial statements are useful for comparing the relative size of different accounts on a company’s balance sheet and income statement, but they do not provide an accurate comparison of a company’s financial performance over time or to other companies in the same industry. Common size financial statements do not take into account changes in the market or the economy that may affect a company’s financial performance.
===Conclusion=== 
Common size financial statements are useful for comparing the relative size of different accounts on a company’s balance sheet and income statement. This type of financial statement provides a more accurate comparison of a company’s financial performance over time or to other companies in the same industry. However, common size financial statements have their limitations and should not be used as the sole basis for making investment decisions.
