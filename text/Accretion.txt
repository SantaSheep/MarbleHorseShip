===Introduction to Accretion === 
Accretion is a financial term used to describe the gradual increase in the value of an asset over time. It is a process that occurs when the value of an asset increases due to the passage of time or due to the addition of new features or services. Accretion is an important concept in finance and accounting, as it can have a significant impact on the value of a company’s assets. In this article, we will discuss what accretion is, the different types of accretion, how to account for accretion, and provide some examples of accretion.
===What is Accretion? === 
Accretion is the gradual increase in the value of an asset over time. This increase in value can be due to the passage of time, the addition of new features or services, or the appreciation of the asset’s underlying value. Accretion is an important concept in finance and accounting, as it can have a significant impact on the value of a company’s assets.
===Types of Accretion === 
There are two main types of accretion: natural accretion and artificial accretion. Natural accretion is the gradual increase in the value of an asset due to the passage of time. This type of accretion is often seen in investments such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Artificial accretion is the increase in the value of an asset due to the addition of new features or services. This type of accretion is often seen in investments such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks.
===Accounting for Accretion === 
Accretion is typically accounted for using the accrual method of accounting. Under this method, the increase in value of an asset is recorded as an expense in the period in which it occurs. This expense is then offset by a corresponding increase in the asset’s value.
===Examples of Accretion === 
One example of natural accretion is the appreciation of a company’s stock over time. As the company’s stock price increases, the value of the company’s assets also increases. Another example of natural accretion is the appreciation of real estate over time. As the value of the real estate increases, the value of the company’s assets also increases.
