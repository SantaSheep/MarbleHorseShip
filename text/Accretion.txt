===Introduction to Accretion===

Accretion is an accounting term that refers to the gradual increase in the value of an asset over time. It is a process of increasing the value of an asset by adding the cost of the asset to the [[Balance Sheet|balance sheet]]. Accretion is a non-cash expense that is recorded on the [[Income Statement|income statement]]. Accretion is a form of amortization, which is the process of spreading out the cost of an asset over its [[Useful Life|useful life]]. Accretion is most commonly used in the context of [[Debt Instrument|debt instrument]]s, such as bonds, but can also be used for other assets, such as [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]].
===Accounting Treatment of Accretion===

Accretion is recorded as a non-cash expense on the income statement. The amount of the accretion is determined by the difference between the [[Face Value|face value]] of the asset and the cost of the asset. The accretion is recorded as an expense in the period in which it occurs. The amount of the accretion is then added to the carrying value of the asset on the balance sheet.
===Accretion of Discounts===

Accretion of discounts is the process of increasing the value of a discounted debt instrument over time. The accretion of discounts is recorded as a non-cash expense on the income statement. The amount of the accretion is determined by the difference between the face value of the debt instrument and the discounted amount. The accretion is recorded as an expense in the period in which it occurs. The amount of the accretion is then added to the carrying value of the debt instrument on the balance sheet.
===Accretion of Premiums===

Accretion of premiums is the process of increasing the value of a premium debt instrument over time. The accretion of premiums is recorded as a non-cash expense on the income statement. The amount of the accretion is determined by the difference between the face value of the debt instrument and the premium amount. The accretion is recorded as an expense in the period in which it occurs. The amount of the accretion is then added to the carrying value of the debt instrument on the balance sheet.
===Accretion of Debt===

Accretion of debt is the process of increasing the value of a debt instrument over time. The accretion of debt is recorded as a non-cash expense on the income statement. The amount of the accretion is determined by the difference between the face value of the debt instrument and the cost of the debt instrument. The accretion is recorded as an expense in the period in which it occurs. The amount of the accretion is then added to the carrying value of the debt instrument on the balance sheet.
===Accretion of Preferred Stock===

Accretion of preferred stock is the process of increasing the value of a preferred stock over time. The accretion of preferred stock is recorded as a non-cash expense on the income statement. The amount of the accretion is determined by the difference between the face value of the preferred stock and the cost of the preferred stock. The accretion is recorded as an expense in t
