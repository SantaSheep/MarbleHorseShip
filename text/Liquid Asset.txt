===Introduction to Liquid Assets === 
Liquid assets are financial assets that can be quickly converted into cash. They are highly liquid and can be used to meet short-term financial obligations. Liquid assets are important for businesses and individuals alike, as they provide a source of liquidity and can be used to cover unexpected expenses or to take advantage of investment opportunities.

This is because they are considered to be low-risk investments and therefore do not offer the same potential for growth as other investments. Additionally, liquid assets are subject to inflation, which can erode their value over time.
