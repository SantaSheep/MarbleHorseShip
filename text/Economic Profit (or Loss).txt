===Definition of Economic Profit (or Loss) === 
Examples of Economic Profit (or Loss): An example of economic profit (or loss) is when a company invests in a new product line. The total revenue generated by the product line is the total sales of the product line minus the cost of producing the product line. The opportunity cost of the investment is the cost of the next best alternative that could have been chosen instead of the product line. If the total revenue generated by the product line is greater than the opportunity cost of the investment, then the company has earned an economic profit. If the total revenue generated by the product line is less than the opportunity cost of the investment, then the company has incurred an economic loss.
