===Introduction to Annual Reports === 
Annual reports are documents that publicly traded companies are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports provide investors with a comprehensive overview of the company’s financial performance and operations over the past year. They include a variety of financial statements, such as the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows, as well as other information about the company’s operations and management. By reading an annual report, investors can gain insight into the company’s financial health and make informed decisions about whether or not to invest in the company.
===Overview of Financial Statements === 
Financial statements are documents that provide investors with information about a company’s financial performance and position. The three main financial statements are the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity at a given point in time. The income statement shows the company’s revenues and expenses over a period of time. The statement of cash flows shows the company’s cash inflows and outflows over a period of time. By reading these financial statements, investors can gain insight into the company’s financial health and make informed decisions about whether or not to invest in the company.
===Analysis of Financial Ratios === 
Financial ratios are mathematical calculations that are used to analyze a company’s financial performance and position. They are calculated by dividing one financial statement item by another. For example, the current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. By analyzing financial ratios, investors can gain insight into the company’s financial health and make informed decisions about whether or not to invest in the company.
===Review of Cash Flow Statements === 
Cash flow statements are documents that provide investors with information about a company’s cash inflows and outflows over a period of time. They include information about the company’s operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. By reading a cash flow statement, investors can gain insight into the company’s financial health and make informed decisions about whether or not to invest in the company.
===Discussion of Earnings Per Share === 
Earnings per share (EPS) is a financial ratio that measures the amount of net income earned per share of common stock outstanding. It is calculated by dividing net income by the number of shares outstanding. By analyzing EPS, investors can gain insight into the company’s financial health and make informed decisions about whether or not to invest in the company.
===Conclusion and Summary of Findings=== 
Annual reports, financial statements, financial ratios, cash flow statements, and earnings per share are all important tools that investors can use to gain insight into a company’s financial health and make informed decisions about whether or not to invest in the company. By reading and analyzing these documents, investors can gain a better understanding of the company’s financial performance and position and make more informed decisions about whether or not to invest in the company.
