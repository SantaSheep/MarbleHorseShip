===Introduction to Key Ratios===

Key ratios are a set of financial metrics used to measure the performance of a company. They are used to compare a company’s performance to that of its peers, industry averages, and other benchmarks. Key ratios are also used to assess the financial health of a company and to make decisions about investing in the company. Key ratios are an important tool for investors, analysts, and other stakeholders in understanding the [[Financial Performance|financial performance]] of a company.
===Types of Key Ratios===

There are several types of key ratios that can be used to measure a company’s performance. These include [[Profitability Ratios|profitability ratios]], [[Liquidity Ratios|liquidity ratios]], [[Efficiency Ratio|efficiency ratio]]s, and [[Leverage Ratio|leverage ratio]]s. Profitability ratios measure a company’s ability to generate profits from its operations. Liquidity ratios measure a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations. Efficiency ratios measure a company’s ability to use its resources efficiently. Leverage ratios measure a company’s ability to finance its operations with debt.
===Uses of Key Ratios===

Key ratios are used to assess the financial health of a company and to make decisions about investing in the company. They can be used to compare a company’s performance to that of its peers, industry averages, and other benchmarks. Key ratios can also be used to identify potential problems in a company’s financial performance.
===Calculating Key Ratios===

Key ratios are calculated by dividing one financial metric by another. For example, the [[Return On Assets|return on assets]] ratio is calculated by dividing [[Net Income|net income]] by total assets. The debt to equity ratio is calculated by dividing [[Total Liabilities|total liabilities]] by total equity. The [[Inventory Turnover|inventory turnover]] ratio is calculated by dividing cost of goods sold by [[Average Inventory|average inventory]].
===Interpreting Key Ratios===

Once key ratios have been calculated, they must be interpreted in order to assess the financial health of a company. Generally, higher ratios are better than lower ratios. For example, a higher return on assets ratio indicates that a company is more profitable than one with a lower return on assets ratio. Similarly, a higher debt to equity ratio indicates that a company is more leveraged than one with a lower debt to equity ratio.
