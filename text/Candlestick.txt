===Introduction to Candlestick===
Candlestick charts are a type of financial chart used to track the price movements of a security over a given period of time. Candlestick charts are one of the most popular charting techniques used by traders and investors to analyze the price movements of a security. Candlestick charts are composed of a series of vertical lines, or “candles”, that represent the opening, closing, high, and low prices of a security over a given period of time. The color of the candle indicates whether the security closed higher or lower than its opening price. Candlestick charts are used to identify potential trading opportunities and to help traders and investors make informed decisions about their investments.
===History of Candlestick===
The origins of candlestick charting can be traced back to the 18th century, when a Japanese rice trader named Homma Munehisa developed a method of charting the price movements of rice. Homma’s method of charting the price movements of rice was later adopted by the Japanese [[Stock Market|stock market]] and eventually spread to the Western world. Candlestick charting has since become one of the most popular charting techniques used by traders and investors to analyze the price movements of a security.
===Types of Candlestick===
There are several different types of candlestick charts, including line, bar, and candlestick. Line charts are the simplest type of chart and are composed of a single line that represents the closing price of a security over a given period of time. Bar charts are composed of vertical lines that represent the opening, closing, high, and low prices of a security over a given period of time. Candlestick charts are composed of a series of vertical lines, or “candles”, that represent the opening, closing, high, and low prices of a security over a given period of time. The color of the candle indicates whether the security closed higher or lower than its opening price.
===Candlestick Analysis===
Candlestick analysis is the process of analyzing the price movements of a security using candlestick charts. Candlestick analysis is used to identify potential trading opportunities and to help traders and investors make informed decisions about their investments. Candlestick analysis involves looking for patterns in the price movements of a security, such as head and shoulders, [[Double Top|double top]]s and bottoms, and other patterns. Candlestick analysis can also be used to identify support and resistance levels, which can be used to determine when to enter and exit a trade.
===Candlestick Patterns===
Candlestick patterns are patterns in the price movements of a security that can be used to identify potential trading opportunities. Some of the most common candlestick patterns include the hammer, the doji, the engulfing pattern, the morning star, and the evening star. Each of these patterns has its own unique characteristics and can be used to identify potential trading opportunities.
