===Introduction to Candlestick Charting - What is a Candlestick Chart?=== 
A candlestick chart is a type of financial chart used to track the price movements of a security, derivative, or currency over time. It is composed of a series of “candles”, each of which consists of a body and two wicks. The body of the candle represents the opening and closing prices of the security, while the wicks represent the highest and lowest prices of the security during the period. Candlestick charts are a popular tool among traders and investors, as they provide a visual representation of price movements and can be used to identify potential trading opportunities.
