===Introduction to Held-to-Maturity (HTM) Securities === 
Held-to-Maturity (HTM) securities are debt instruments that a company has the intent and ability to hold until maturity. These securities are typically bonds, notes, or other debt instruments that are purchased with the intention of holding them until they reach their maturity date. HTM securities are considered to be a long-term investment and are typically held for more than one year.
===Characteristics of HTM Securities === 
HTM securities are characterized by their fixed rate of return, fixed maturity date, and fixed principal amount. These securities are typically issued by governments, corporations, or other entities and are usually denominated in a specific currency. HTM securities are also typically non-callable, meaning that the issuer cannot redeem the security prior to its maturity date.
===Accounting Treatment of HTM Securities === 
HTM securities are typically accounted for using the amortized cost method. Under this method, the security is recorded at its purchase price and is then amortized over its life. The amortization is based on the interest rate of the security and the remaining principal balance. The amortization is recorded as an expense on the companyâ€™s income statement.
===Advantages of HTM Securities === 
The primary advantage of HTM securities is that they provide a fixed rate of return and a fixed maturity date. This makes them attractive to investors who are looking for a predictable and reliable return on their investment. Additionally, HTM securities are typically non-callable, meaning that the issuer cannot redeem the security prior to its maturity date. This provides investors with the assurance that their investment will not be called away before they have had the opportunity to realize the full return on their investment.
===Disadvantages of HTM Securities === 
The primary disadvantage of HTM securities is that they are typically illiquid. This means that they cannot be easily sold or traded prior to their maturity date. Additionally, HTM securities are subject to interest rate risk, meaning that if interest rates rise, the value of the security will decrease. Finally, HTM securities are subject to credit risk, meaning that if the issuer defaults on the security, the investor may not receive the full return on their investment.
===Conclusion=== 
HTM securities are a type of debt instrument that are typically held until maturity. These securities are characterized by their fixed rate of return, fixed maturity date, and fixed principal amount. They are typically accounted for using the amortized cost method and provide investors with a predictable and reliable return on their investment. However, they are also subject to illiquidity, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
