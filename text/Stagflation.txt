===Introduction to Stagflation===
Stagflation is an economic phenomenon that occurs when an economy experiences both high inflation and high unemployment at the same time. This phenomenon is often seen as a sign of economic stagnation, as it indicates that the economy is not growing and is instead stuck in a state of stagnation. Stagflation is a difficult economic situation to address, as it requires both fiscal and [[Monetary Policy|monetary policy]] to be adjusted in order to bring the economy back to a healthy state.
===Causes of Stagflation===
Stagflation is caused by a combination of factors, including supply-side shocks, demand-side shocks, and monetary policy. Supply-side shocks are caused by a decrease in the supply of goods and services, which can be caused by a decrease in the availability of resources or an increase in the cost of production. Demand-side shocks are caused by a decrease in the demand for goods and services, which can be caused by a decrease in consumer spending or an increase in taxes. Finally, monetary policy can cause stagflation if it is too tight or too loose, as it can lead to an increase in the cost of borrowing and a decrease [[In The Money|in the money]] supply.
===Effects of Stagflation===
The effects of stagflation can be severe, as it can lead to a decrease in [[Economic Growth|economic growth]], an increase in unemployment, and a decrease in the [[Purchasing Power|purchasing power]] of consumers. Additionally, stagflation can lead to an increase in the cost of borrowing, as lenders may be less willing to lend money due to the increased risk associated with lending in a stagnant economy. Finally, stagflation can lead to an increase in inequality, as those with higher incomes are more likely to benefit from the higher inflation rate than those with lower incomes.
===Historical Examples of Stagflation===
