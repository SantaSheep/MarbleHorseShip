The Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio is a financial metric used to measure the relative value of a company’s stock.

For example, if a company’s stock is currently trading at $50 per share and its EPS is $2, then the P/E ratio would be 25 (50/2). This means that for every $1 of earnings, the stock is trading at $25.
===Uses of P/E Ratio===

The P/E ratio is a useful tool for investors to compare the relative value of different stocks. It can be used to determine the potential return on investment and to identify stocks that may be undervalued or overvalued.

It is calculated by dividing the current market price of a company’s stock by its earnings per share (EPS). The P/E ratio is a useful tool for investors to compare the relative value of different stocks and to determine the potential return on investment.
