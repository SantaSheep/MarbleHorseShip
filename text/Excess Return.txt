===Introduction to Excess Return===

Excess return is a financial term used to describe the return on an investment that exceeds the return of a benchmark index or other measure of performance. It is a measure of the performance of an investment relative to a benchmark, and is often used to evaluate the performance of a portfolio manager or [[Mutual Fund|mutual fund]].
