===Introduction to Harmonic Mean === 
Harmonic mean is a type of average used to calculate the average of a set of numbers. It is used to calculate the average of a set of numbers that are reciprocals of each other. The harmonic mean is different from the arithmetic mean, which is the most commonly used type of average. The harmonic mean is often used when dealing with rates or ratios, such as speed or growth rates.
===Calculating Harmonic Mean === 
The harmonic mean is calculated by taking the reciprocal of each number in the set, adding them together, and then taking the reciprocal of the sum. The formula for calculating the harmonic mean is:
===Examples of Harmonic Mean === 

===Benefits of Harmonic Mean === 
Examples of Harmonic Mean
===Limitations of Harmonic Mean === 
Another example of the harmonic mean is when calculating the average growth rate of a company over a certain period of time. The harmonic mean of the growth rate is calculated by taking the reciprocal of the growth rate for each period, adding them together, and then taking the reciprocal of the sum.
===Conclusion === 
The harmonic mean is useful when dealing with rates or ratios, such as speed or growth rates. It is also useful when dealing with numbers that are reciprocals of each other. The harmonic mean is more accurate than the arithmetic mean when dealing with these types of numbers.
