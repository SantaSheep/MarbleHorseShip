This can occur when a company’s sales are lower than expected, or when its costs are higher than expected.

===Examples of Net Operating Loss===

A company may have a net operating loss if its sales are lower than expected, or if its costs are higher than expected. For example, if a company’s sales are lower than expected due to a decrease in demand, then its operating income will be lower than its operating expenses. This will result in a net operating loss. Similarly, if a company’s costs are higher than expected due to an increase in the cost of [[Raw Materials|raw materials]], then its operating expenses will be higher than its operating income, resulting in a net operating loss.
