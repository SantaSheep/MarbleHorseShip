===Introduction to Confidence Interval === 

===Calculating Confidence Interval === 
Examples of Confidence Interval - A confidence interval can be used to estimate the population mean, population proportion, population variance, and population standard deviation. For example, if you have a sample of 100 people and you want to estimate the population mean, you can calculate a 95% confidence interval. This would give you a range of values that is likely to contain the population mean with 95% confidence.

Conclusion - Confidence intervals are a useful tool for estimating population parameters from sample statistics. They provide a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter with a certain level of confidence. However, they are only as accurate as the sample that is used to calculate them and the confidence level that is chosen.
