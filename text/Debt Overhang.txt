===Introduction to Debt Overhang===
Debt overhang is a term used to describe a situation in which a company has a large amount of debt relative to its assets and income. This can lead to a situation in which the company is unable to service its debt, leading to a decrease in its creditworthiness and an increase in its risk of default. Debt overhang can be caused by a variety of factors, including excessive borrowing, poor management of debt, and macroeconomic conditions. It can have a significant impact on a company’s ability to access capital and can lead to a decrease in its stock price.
===Causes of Debt Overhang===
Debt overhang can be caused by a variety of factors. Excessive borrowing is one of the most common causes of debt overhang. Companies may borrow too much money in order to finance expansion or acquisitions, or to cover operating expenses. This can lead to a situation in which the company is unable to service its debt, leading to a decrease in its creditworthiness and an increase in its risk of default. Poor management of debt is another common cause of debt overhang. Companies may fail to properly manage their debt, leading to a situation in which the company is unable to service its debt. This can lead to a decrease in its creditworthiness and an increase in its risk of default. Macroeconomic conditions can also lead to debt overhang. A recession or other economic downturn can lead to a decrease in a company’s income, making it difficult for the company to service its debt.
===Effects of Debt Overhang===
Debt overhang can have a significant impact on a company’s ability to access capital. Companies with high levels of debt are seen as riskier investments, and lenders may be unwilling to provide financing to such companies. This can lead to a decrease in the company’s ability to access capital, which can have a negative impact on its ability to grow and expand. Debt overhang can also lead to a decrease in the company’s stock price. Investors may be wary of investing in a company with high levels of debt, leading to a decrease in the company’s stock price.
===Strategies to Mitigate Debt Overhang===
There are a number of strategies that companies can use to mitigate debt overhang. One of the most effective strategies is to reduce the amount of debt the company has. This can be done by refinancing existing debt, selling off assets, or reducing operating expenses. Companies can also use [[Debt Restructuring|debt restructuring]] to reduce their debt burden.

This involves issuing new shares of stock to raise capital, which can be used to pay off existing debt.
