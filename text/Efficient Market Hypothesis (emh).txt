===Introduction to Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) === 
The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is an investment theory that states that it is impossible to “beat the market” because stock market efficiency causes existing share prices to always incorporate and reflect all relevant information. This means that it is impossible to consistently achieve returns in excess of the average market return by using any combination of analysis, forecasting, or market timing.
===Overview of EMH Theory === 
The EMH was first proposed by Eugene Fama in the 1960s and has since become one of the most widely accepted theories in finance. The theory states that all available information is already reflected in the price of a security, and that it is impossible to consistently outperform the market by using any combination of analysis, forecasting, or market timing. The EMH also states that the markets are “informationally efficient”, meaning that all available information is quickly and accurately incorporated into the price of a security.
===Types of EMH === 
The EMH can be divided into three distinct types: weak-form, semi-strong form, and strong-form. The weak-form of the EMH states that past prices and price patterns are not useful in predicting future prices. The semi-strong form of the EMH states that all publicly available information is already reflected in the price of a security. The strong-form of the EMH states that all information, both public and private, is already reflected in the price of a security.
===Evidence for EMH === 
There is a large body of evidence that supports the EMH. Studies have shown that stock prices are unpredictable in the short-term, and that it is impossible to consistently outperform the market by using any combination of analysis, forecasting, or market timing. Additionally, studies have shown that stock prices quickly and accurately incorporate new information, which is consistent with the EMH.
===Criticisms of EMH === 
The EMH has been criticized for its unrealistic assumptions and its inability to explain certain market phenomena. Critics of the EMH argue that the markets are not always “informationally efficient”, and that it is possible to outperform the market by using certain strategies. Additionally, critics of the EMH argue that the markets are not always “rational”, and that irrational behavior can lead to market bubbles and crashes.
===Conclusion=== 
The Efficient Market Hypothesis is one of the most widely accepted theories in finance. The EMH states that it is impossible to consistently outperform the market by using any combination of analysis, forecasting, or market timing. There is a large body of evidence that supports the EMH, although it has been criticized for its unrealistic assumptions and its inability to explain certain market phenomena.
