A Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a unique identifier used to track inventory in a retail or manufacturing setting. It is a combination of letters and numbers that is assigned to a specific product or item. SKUs are used to track inventory, manage pricing, and identify products for sale. They are also used to track sales and customer orders. SKUs are essential for any business that sells products, as they provide a way to keep track of inventory and ensure that products are available when customers need them.

Using SKUs can help businesses save time and money by streamlining their inventory management processes. SKUs can help businesses keep track of their inventory more accurately, as they provide a unique identifier for each product. This can help businesses avoid overstocking or understocking their inventory, which can lead to lost sales or excess inventory costs. SKUs can also help businesses identify products quickly and accurately, which can help reduce customer wait times and improve customer satisfaction.
===How to Create an SKU === 
Creating an SKU is relatively simple. The first step is to decide on a format for the SKU. This can be a combination of letters and numbers, or just numbers.

This can be done manually or with a software program.
