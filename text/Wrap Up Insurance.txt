===Introduction to Wrap-Up Insurance === 
Wrap-up insurance is a type of insurance that provides coverage for multiple projects or activities under one policy. It is designed to protect the interests of all parties involved in a project, including the contractor, subcontractors, and the owner. Wrap-up insurance is also known as a “single project policy” or “owner-controlled insurance program” (OCIP). It is a cost-effective way to manage risk and ensure that all parties involved in a project are adequately protected.
===Benefits of Wrap-Up Insurance === 
Wrap-up insurance offers a number of benefits to all parties involved in a project. It provides a single source of coverage for all parties, eliminating the need for multiple policies. This reduces paperwork and administrative costs. It also simplifies the claims process, as all claims are handled through the same insurer. Additionally, wrap-up insurance can provide coverage for risks that may not be covered by traditional insurance policies, such as pollution liability.
===Types of Wrap-Up Insurance === 
There are several types of wrap-up insurance available. These include general liability, property damage, workers’ compensation, and pollution liability. Each type of coverage provides protection for different risks associated with a project.
===How Wrap-Up Insurance Works === 
Wrap-up insurance is typically purchased by the owner of a project. The owner will then select an insurer to provide the coverage. The insurer will then create a policy that covers all parties involved in the project. The policy will include the scope of coverage, the limits of liability, and the premiums to be paid.
===Cost of Wrap-Up Insurance === 
The cost of wrap-up insurance will vary depending on the type of coverage and the scope of the project. Generally, the larger the project, the higher the cost of the policy. Additionally, the cost of the policy will depend on the type of coverage and the limits of liability.
===Conclusion=== 
Wrap-up insurance is a cost-effective way to manage risk and ensure that all parties involved in a project are adequately protected. It provides a single source of coverage for all parties, eliminating the need for multiple policies. Additionally, it can provide coverage for risks that may not be covered by traditional insurance policies.
