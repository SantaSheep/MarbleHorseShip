===Introduction to Operating Lease===
An operating lease is a type of lease agreement that allows a lessee to use an asset for a specified period of time in exchange for periodic payments. Operating leases are commonly used for equipment, vehicles, and other assets that are used in the day-to-day operations of a business. Operating leases are different from [[Capital Lease|capital lease]]s, which are used to finance the purchase of an asset.
===Types of Operating Leases===

Operating leases offer several advantages to lessees. First, they provide flexibility, as the lessee can return the asset at the end of the lease term without any additional payments.

Third, operating leases can be used to acquire assets that may become obsolete quickly, such as technology equipment. Finally, operating leases can be used to acquire assets that may not be available for purchase.

Finally, the lessee may be responsible for any damage to the asset during the lease term.
