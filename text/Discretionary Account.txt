===Introduction to Discretionary Accounts === 
Discretionary accounts are a type of investment account that allows the account holder to make decisions about how the funds are invested. This type of account is typically managed by a professional financial advisor who has the authority to make decisions on behalf of the account holder. Discretionary accounts are often used by individuals who want to delegate the responsibility of managing their investments to a professional.
===Benefits of Discretionary Accounts === 
Discretionary accounts offer a number of benefits to investors. First, they allow investors to delegate the responsibility of managing their investments to a professional. This can be beneficial for those who do not have the time or expertise to manage their own investments. Additionally, discretionary accounts can provide access to a wider range of investments than what is available to individual investors. Finally, discretionary accounts can provide tax advantages, as the account holder can take advantage of certain tax deductions and credits.
===Types of Discretionary Accounts === 
There are several types of discretionary accounts available to investors. These include managed accounts, which are typically managed by a professional financial advisor; self-directed accounts, which allow the account holder to make their own investment decisions; and pooled accounts, which are managed by a group of investors.
===How to Open a Discretionary Account === 
Opening a discretionary account is relatively straightforward. First, the investor must select a financial advisor or institution to manage the account. The investor will then need to provide the necessary paperwork, such as a copy of their driverâ€™s license and Social Security number, as well as any other documents required by the financial institution. Once the paperwork is completed, the investor will need to fund the account with the desired amount of money.
===Risks of Discretionary Accounts === 
Discretionary accounts come with certain risks. First, the account holder is relying on the financial advisor to make sound decisions on their behalf. If the advisor makes poor decisions, the account holder could suffer significant losses. Additionally, the account holder is subject to the fees and commissions charged by the financial advisor. Finally, the account holder is subject to the risk of the investments in the account, which could result in losses.
===Conclusion === 
Discretionary accounts can be a useful tool for investors who want to delegate the responsibility of managing their investments to a professional. However, it is important to understand the risks associated with these accounts before investing. By understanding the benefits and risks of discretionary accounts, investors can make informed decisions about whether this type of account is right for them.
