===Introduction to Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) === 
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model used to determine the expected return of an asset based on its risk. It is a widely used tool in finance and investment, and is used to calculate the expected return of a security or portfolio of securities. The CAPM is based on the idea that investors require a higher return for taking on additional risk.
===Overview of CAPM Theory === 
The CAPM theory states that the expected return of an asset is equal to the risk-free rate of return plus a risk premium. The risk premium is determined by the asset's beta, which is a measure of the asset's volatility relative to the market. The higher the beta, the higher the expected return. The CAPM theory also states that all investors have the same expectations of return and risk, and that they are all rational and have access to the same information.
