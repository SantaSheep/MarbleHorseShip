===Introduction to Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) === 
Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) is a financial concept used to compare the cost of different investments over a period of time. It is a useful tool for businesses to determine which investment option is the most cost-effective in the long run. EAC takes into account the cost of the investment, the expected life of the investment, and the expected rate of return on the investment. By calculating the EAC, businesses can make informed decisions about which investments are the most cost-effective.
===Calculating EAC === 
The EAC is calculated by taking the total cost of the investment and dividing it by the expected life of the investment. This calculation is then multiplied by the expected rate of return on the investment. The result is the EAC, which is expressed in terms of an annual cost.
===Advantages of EAC === 
The main advantage of using EAC is that it allows businesses to compare the cost of different investments over a period of time. By calculating the EAC, businesses can determine which investment option is the most cost-effective in the long run. This helps businesses make informed decisions about which investments are the most cost-effective.
===Disadvantages of EAC === 
The main disadvantage of using EAC is that it does not take into account the potential risks associated with an investment. For example, if an investment has a high expected rate of return, but also carries a high risk of loss, the EAC calculation may not accurately reflect the true cost of the investment.
===Examples of EAC === 
One example of EAC is when a business is deciding between two investments. The first investment has a total cost of $10,000 and an expected life of 10 years. The second investment has a total cost of $15,000 and an expected life of 15 years. By calculating the EAC of each investment, the business can determine which investment is the most cost-effective in the long run.
===Conclusion === 
Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) is a useful tool for businesses to compare the cost of different investments over a period of time. By calculating the EAC, businesses can make informed decisions about which investments are the most cost-effective in the long run. However, it is important to remember that EAC does not take into account the potential risks associated with an investment.
