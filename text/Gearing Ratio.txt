===Introduction to Gearing Ratio===

Gearing ratio is a financial metric used to measure the degree of leverage used by a company. It is calculated by dividing the total debt of a company by its total equity. The higher the gearing ratio, the more debt a company has relative to its equity. Gearing ratio is an important measure of a company’s financial health and can be used to assess the risk associated with investing in a company.
===Calculation of Gearing Ratio===

Gearing ratio is calculated by dividing the total debt of a company by its total equity. Total debt includes both short-term and long-term debt, such as loans, bonds, and other forms of debt. Total equity includes the company’s shareholders’ equity, which is the difference between the company’s assets and liabilities.
===Types of Gearing Ratios===

There are several types of gearing ratios that can be used to measure a company’s financial health. These include the debt-to-equity ratio, the debt-to-assets ratio, and the debt-to-capital ratio. Each of these ratios measures the degree of leverage used by a company and can be used to assess the risk associated with investing in a company.
