===Introduction to Rollover Risk===

Rollover risk is a type of [[Financial Risk|financial risk]] that arises when a [[Financial Instrument|financial instrument]], such as a loan or a bond, is rolled over from one period to another. This type of risk is most commonly associated with fixed-income investments, such as bonds, but can also be applicable to other types of investments, such as derivatives. Rollover risk is the risk that the terms of the new instrument may be different from the terms of the original instrument, resulting in a loss of value or a change in the [[Expected Return|expected return]].
===Types of Rollover Risk===

There are two main types of rollover risk: [[Interest Rate|interest rate]] risk and [[Credit Risk|credit risk]]. Interest rate risk is the risk that the interest rate on the new instrument will be different from the interest rate on the original instrument. This can result in a loss of value or a change in the expected return. Credit risk is the risk that the issuer of the new instrument will not be able to meet its obligations, resulting in a loss of value or a change in the expected return.
===Causes of Rollover Risk===

Rollover risk can be caused by a variety of factors, including changes in market conditions, changes in the issuer’s creditworthiness, and changes in the terms of the instrument. Changes in market conditions can cause interest rates to change, resulting in a change in the expected return. Changes in the issuer’s creditworthiness can cause the issuer to be unable to meet its obligations, resulting in a loss of value or a change in the expected return. Changes in the terms of the instrument can also cause a change in the expected return.
===Strategies to Mitigate Rollover Risk===

There are several strategies that can be used to mitigate rollover risk. These include diversifying investments, hedging, and using derivatives. Diversifying investments can help to reduce the risk of a single instrument, as the losses from one instrument can be offset by gains from another. Hedging can be used to reduce the risk of a single instrument by taking a position in a related instrument. Finally, derivatives can be used to hedge against changes in the terms of the instrument.
