===Introduction to Equity Multiplier === 
Equity multiplier is a financial ratio that measures the amount of a company’s assets that are financed by its shareholders’ equity. It is also known as the leverage ratio or the debt-equity ratio. The equity multiplier is calculated by dividing the total assets of a company by its shareholders’ equity. It is used to measure the financial leverage of a company and to compare the financial leverage of different companies.
===Calculating Equity Multiplier ===

For example, if a company has total assets of $100 million and shareholders’ equity of $50 million, the equity multiplier would be 2.0. This means that the company has twice as much debt as equity.
