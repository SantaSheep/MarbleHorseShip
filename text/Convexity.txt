===Introduction to Convexity === 

===What is Convexity? === 
How Does Convexity Affect Bond Prices? - Convexity affects bond prices in two ways. First, it affects the price of the bond when interest rates change. When interest rates rise, the price of a bond with high convexity will fall more than the price of a bond with low convexity. Conversely, when interest rates fall, the price of a bond with high convexity will rise more than the price of a bond with low convexity. Second, it affects the duration of the bond. The higher the convexity, the longer the duration of the bond.
