===Introduction to Writedown===

A writedown is a reduction in the value of an asset or liability that is recorded on a company’s [[Balance Sheet|balance sheet]]. It is a way for a company to recognize a decrease in the value of an asset or liability due to a variety of factors, such as market conditions, technological obsolescence, or changes in the company’s business model. A writedown is also known as a write-off or impairment.
===Types of Writedowns===

There are two types of writedowns: permanent and temporary. A permanent writedown is a reduction in the value of an asset or liability that is expected to remain at the reduced value for the foreseeable future. A temporary writedown is a reduction in the value of an asset or liability that is expected to recover in value over time.
===Reasons for Writedowns===

Writedowns can be caused by a variety of factors, including market conditions, technological obsolescence, or changes in the company’s business model. For example, a company may need to write down the value of its inventory if the market price of the inventory has decreased. Similarly, a company may need to write down the value of its equipment if the equipment has become obsolete due to advances in technology. Finally, a company may need to write down the value of its assets if the company has changed its business model and the assets are no longer necessary.
===Accounting Treatment of Writedowns===

When a writedown is recorded, the value of the asset or liability is reduced on the company’s balance sheet. The amount of the writedown is recorded as an expense on the company’s [[Income Statement|income statement]]. The writedown is also recorded as a contra-asset on the balance sheet, which is an asse[[T Account|t account]] that is offset against the value of the asset or liability that was written down.
