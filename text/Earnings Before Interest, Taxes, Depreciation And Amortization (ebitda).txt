===Advantages of EBITDA === 
Conclusion: EBITDA is a useful measure of a company’s operating performance and is often used to compare the profitability of different companies in the same industry. However, it does not include non-operating items such as interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and does not take into account the capital structure of a company. Therefore, it should not be used as the sole measure of a company’s financial performance.
