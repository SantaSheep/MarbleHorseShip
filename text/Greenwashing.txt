Greenwashing is a term used to describe the deceptive marketing of products and services as being environmentally friendly. It is a form of corporate spin that is used to make a company appear to be more environmentally conscious than it actually is. The term was first coined in 1986 by environmentalist Jay Westervelt, and has since become a popular way for companies to make their products and services appear more sustainable and eco-friendly.
===Definition of Greenwashing === 
Greenwashing is the practice of making false or misleading claims about the environmental benefits of a product, service, or company.

They should look for third-party certifications, such as the Green Seal or Eco-Label, which indicate that a product has been independently verified as being environmentally friendly. Additionally, consumers should research a company’s environmental policies and practices to ensure that they are actually committed to sustainability.
