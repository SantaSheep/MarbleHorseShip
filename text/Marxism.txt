===Introduction to Marxism === 
Marxism is a political and economic theory developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the 19th century. It is based on the idea that the world is divided into two classes: the bourgeoisie, or the owners of the means of production, and the proletariat, or the working class. Marxism seeks to explain the exploitation of the working class by the bourgeoisie and to provide a framework for a revolutionary transformation of society. Marxism is a materialist philosophy that views history as a struggle between classes, and it is based on the idea that the working class can and should overthrow the capitalist system and create a more just and equitable society.
===Marxist Theory of Class Struggle === 
Marxism views class struggle as the driving force of history. According to Marx, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are in a constant struggle for power and resources. The bourgeoisie, or the owners of the means of production, seek to maintain their power and wealth, while the proletariat, or the working class, seek to gain more power and resources. This struggle is seen as the main source of social change and progress.
===Marxist Theory of Alienation === 
Marxism views alienation as a result of the capitalist system. According to Marx, the capitalist system creates a separation between the worker and the product of their labor. The worker is alienated from the product of their labor, as they do not own it and do not have control over it. This alienation leads to a feeling of powerlessness and a lack of control over oneâ€™s life.
===Marxist Theory of Historical Materialism === 
Marxism views history as a struggle between classes. According to Marx, the history of all societies is the history of class struggle. This struggle is seen as the main source of social change and progress. Marx argued that the working class will eventually overthrow the capitalist system and create a more just and equitable society.
===Marxist Theory of Revolution === 
Marxism views revolution as the only way to achieve a more just and equitable society. According to Marx, the working class must overthrow the capitalist system and create a new society based on the principles of equality and justice. Marx argued that the working class must organize and fight for their rights in order to achieve a revolution.
