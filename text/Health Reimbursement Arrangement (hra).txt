A Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) is a type of employer-funded health benefit plan that allows employers to reimburse employees for certain medical expenses. An HRA is a tax-advantaged account that employers can use to reimburse employees for qualified medical expenses. The employer funds the HRA and the employee can use the funds to pay for eligible medical expenses. The employer can also set limits on the amount of money that can be reimbursed.

Employers can set limits on the amount of money that can be reimbursed, which helps to control costs. HRAs also provide employers with a way to attract and retain employees by offering them a tax-advantaged benefit.

In order to be eligible for an HRA, employees must meet certain criteria. Generally, employees must be employed by the employer for at least one year and must be actively employed at the time of reimbursement. Employees must also be enrolled in a qualified health plan in order to be eligible for an HRA.
===How to Set Up an HRA ===

===Example of an HRA Plan=== 
An example of an HRA plan is as follows: The employer contributes $2,000 per year to the HRA. Employees can use the funds to pay for eligible medical expenses, such as doctor visits, prescription drugs, and medical equipment. The employer sets a limit of $500 per year for each employee. Any unused funds will roll over to the next year.
