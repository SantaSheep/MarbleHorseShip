===Introduction to Life Insurance===

Life insurance is a type of insurance policy that provides financial protection to the policyholder’s family in the event of their death. It is designed to provide financial security to the policyholder’s family in the event of their death, and can be used to cover funeral expenses, medical bills, and other debts. Life insurance can also be used to provide a lump sum of money to the policyholder’s family in the event of their death, which can be used to pay for college tuition, a new home, or other expenses.

It is typically the most affordable type of life insurance, and is designed to provide financial protection for a specific period of time. Permanent life insurance, on the other hand, is designed to provide coverage for the policyholder’s entire life.
