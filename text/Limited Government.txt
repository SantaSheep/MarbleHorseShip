This idea was later adopted by the Roman Republic and the United States Constitution.
===Benefits of Limited Government === 
The main benefit of limited government is that it allows citizens to have more freedom and autonomy. This type of government also allows citizens to have more control over their own lives and decisions. Additionally, limited government can help to reduce the amount of corruption and abuse of power that can occur in a government with too much power.

Additionally, limited government can lead to a lack of accountability and transparency in government.
===Examples of Limited Government ===
