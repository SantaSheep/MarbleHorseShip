===Introduction to Limited Government===

Limited government is a political concept that advocates for a government that is limited in its power and scope. It is based on the idea that government should only have the power to do what is necessary to protect the rights of its citizens and should not be allowed to interfere in the lives of its citizens beyond what is necessary. This concept has been around for centuries and has been used to shape the governments of many countries.
===History of Limited Government===

The concept of limited government has its roots in ancient Greece and Rome. In these societies, the government was limited in its power and scope and citizens were given certain rights and freedoms that were protected by the government. This concept was further developed during the Enlightenment period in Europe, when philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued for a government that was limited in its power and scope. This concept was then adopted by the United States in its Constitution, which limited the power of the federal government and gave citizens certain rights and freedoms.
