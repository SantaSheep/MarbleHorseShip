===Introduction to Bond Yield===

Bond yield is a measure of the return on a bond investment. It is the amount of interest earned on a bond, expressed as a percentage of the bond’s [[Face Value|face value]]. Bond yield is an important concept for investors, as it helps them to determine the potential return on their investment. Bond yield is also used by governments and corporations to determine the cost of borrowing money.
===Types of Bond Yields===

There are several different types of bond yields. The most common type of bond yield is the coupon yield, which is the [[Interest Rate|interest rate]] stated on the bond. Other types of bond yields include current yield, [[Yield To Maturity|yield to maturity]], and yield to call.

Current yield is the annual return on a bond, expressed as a percentage of the bond’s current market price. Yield to maturity is the total return on a bond if it is held until its maturity date. Yield to call is the total return on a bond if it is called prior to its maturity date.
===Factors Affecting Bond Yields===

Bond yields are affected by a variety of factors, including the creditworthiness of the issuer, the maturity date of the bond, the coupon rate, and the current market interest rate. The creditworthiness of the issuer is important because it affects the risk of default. The maturity date of the bond affects the amount of time the investor has to wait for the return on their investment. The coupon rate affects the amount of interest earned on the bond. Finally, the current market interest rate affects the return on the bond relative to other investments.
===Calculating Bond Yields===

Bond yields can be calculated using a variety of methods. The most common method is to divide the coupon rate by the current market price of the bond. This will give the current yield of the bond. To calculate the yield to maturity, the investor must take into account the coupon payments, the current market price, and the maturity date of the bond. To calculate the yield to call, the investor must take into account the coupon payments, the current market price, and the call date of the bond.
