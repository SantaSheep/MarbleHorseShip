===Introduction to Loan To Cost Ratio (LTC)===

Loan to cost ratio (LTC) is a financial metric used to measure the amount of debt financing used to fund a project relative to the total cost of the project. It is a key indicator of the financial health of a project and is used to assess the risk associated with the project. The higher the LTC ratio, the more debt financing is used to fund the project and the higher the risk associated with the project.
===Definition of Loan To Cost Ratio (LTC)===

Loan to cost ratio (LTC) is a financial metric used to measure the amount of debt financing used to fund a project relative to the total cost of the project. It is calculated by dividing the total amount of debt financing used to fund the project by the total cost of the project. The resulting ratio is expressed as a percentage.
===Calculation of Loan To Cost Ratio (LTC)===

The loan to cost ratio (LTC) is calculated by dividing the total amount of debt financing used to fund the project by the total cost of the project. For example, if a project has a total cost of $1,000,000 and the total amount of debt financing used to fund the project is $500,000, the loan to cost ratio (LTC) would be 50%.

The loan to cost ratio (LTC) does not take into account other factors that may affect the financial health of a project, such as the cost of materials, labor, and other expenses. Additionally, the LTC ratio does not take into account the potential returns from the project, which may be higher or lower than the amount of debt financing used to fund the project.
