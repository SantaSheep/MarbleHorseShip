===Introduction to Hierarchy of GAAP === 
The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting used in the United States. It includes the standards, conventions, and rules that accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions, and in the preparation of financial statements. The GAAP hierarchy is the structure of the accounting standards that are used to prepare financial statements. It is important to understand the hierarchy of GAAP in order to ensure that financial statements are prepared in accordance with the appropriate standards.
===Level 1: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) === 
The highest level of the GAAP hierarchy is the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These are the most comprehensive set of accounting standards and are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The GAAP includes the concepts, principles, and rules that are used to prepare financial statements. The GAAP is the foundation of the accounting profession and is the basis for all other accounting standards.
===Level 2: Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) === 
The second level of the GAAP hierarchy is the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The ASC is a comprehensive set of accounting standards issued by the FASB. The ASC includes all of the authoritative accounting literature issued by the FASB, including the GAAP. The ASC is organized into topics and subtopics, and is used to ensure that financial statements are prepared in accordance with the appropriate standards.
===Level 3: Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) === 
The third level of the GAAP hierarchy is the Accounting Standards Updates (ASU). The ASU is a set of accounting standards issued by the FASB that are intended to clarify or modify existing GAAP. The ASU is used to ensure that financial statements are prepared in accordance with the most up-to-date accounting standards.
===Level 4: Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) === 
The fourth level of the GAAP hierarchy is the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF). The EITF is a group of experts that is convened by the FASB to address emerging accounting issues. The EITF is responsible for issuing guidance on accounting issues that are not addressed by existing GAAP.
===Conclusion === 
The GAAP hierarchy is an important structure of accounting standards that is used to ensure that financial statements are prepared in accordance with the appropriate standards. The GAAP hierarchy includes the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the Accounting Standards Updates (ASU), and the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF). Understanding the GAAP hierarchy is essential for preparing financial statements in accordance with the appropriate standards.
