Business risk is the potential for a business to suffer losses due to external factors such as economic downturns, competition, or changes in the market. It is an inherent part of any business and can have a significant impact on the success or failure of a business.

Internal risks are those that are within the control of the business, such as operational risks, [[Financial Risk|financial risk]]s, and strategic risks.

Each type of risk has its own unique characteristics and can have a significant impact on the success or failure of a business.

Assessing business risk involves analyzing the potential risks and their potential impacts on the business. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as risk assessment tools, [[Risk Management|risk management]] frameworks, and risk analysis techniques. By assessing the risks, businesses can identify potential areas of vulnerability and develop strategies to mitigate or manage them.
===Managing Business Risk===

Once the risks have been identified and assessed, businesses can develop strategies to manage them. This can include developing risk management plans, implementing risk management processes, and establishing risk management policies. Risk management plans should include strategies for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks, as well as strategies for monitoring and responding to risks.
