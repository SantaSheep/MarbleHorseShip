Return on Investment (ROI) is a financial metric used to measure the profitability of an investment. It is calculated by dividing the net gain or loss of an investment by the total amount invested. ROI is a useful tool for investors to evaluate the performance of their investments and compare them to other investments. It is also used by businesses to measure the efficiency of their investments in terms of the returns they generate.

The formula for calculating ROI is simple: ROI = (Gain from Investment – Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment. The gain from an investment can be either a positive or negative number, depending on the performance of the investment. The cost of an investment is the amount of money that was initially invested.

For example, if an investor invests $100 in a stock and the stock increases in value to $150, the gain from the investment is $50. The ROI in this case would be (50 – 100) / 100 = -0.5, or a 50% loss.
