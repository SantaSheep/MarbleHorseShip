===Introduction to Book-to-Market Ratio===

The book-to-market ratio (B/) is a financial ratio used to measure the relative value of a company’s stock. It is calculated by dividing the company’s [[Book Value|book value]] (the total value of its assets minus its liabilities) by its market value (the current price of its stock). The book-to-market ratio is used to compare the relative value of a company’s stock to its peers. It is also used to identify undervalued stocks that may be good investments.
===Calculation of Book-to-Market Ratio===

The book-to-market ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s book value by its market value. The book value is calculated by subtracting the company’s liabilities from its assets. The market value is calculated by multiplying the current price of the company’s stock by the number of shares outstanding.

For example, if a company has assets of $100 million and liabilities of $50 million, its book value is $50 million. If the current price of the company’s stock is $10 per share and there are 10 million shares outstanding, the market value is $100 million. The book-to-market ratio is then calculated by dividing the book value ($50 million) by the market value ($100 million), resulting in a book-to-market ratio of 0.5.
===Uses of Book-to-Market Ratio===

The book-to-market ratio is used to compare the relative value of a company’s stock to its peers. A higher book-to-market ratio indicates that the company’s stock is undervalued relative to its peers. Conversely, a lower book-to-market ratio indicates that the company’s stock is overvalued relative to its peers.

The book-to-market ratio is also used to identify undervalued stocks that may be good investments. Stocks with a high book-to-market ratio are often considered to be undervalued and may be good investments.
===Limitations of Book-to-Market Ratio===

The book-to-market ratio is a useful tool for comparing the relative value of a company’s stock to its peers, but it has some limitations. The book-to-market ratio does not take into account the company’s future prospects or the quality of its management. It also does not take into account the company’s debt or other liabilities.
===Conclusion===

The book-to-market ratio is a financial ratio used to measure the relative value of a company’s stock. It is calculated by dividing the company’s book value by its market value. The book-to-market ratio is used to compare the relative value of a company’s stock to its peers and to identify undervalued stocks that may be good investments. However, the book-to-market ratio has some limitations and should not be used as the sole basis for making investment decisions
