===Introduction to Financial Statements === 
Financial statements are documents that provide a snapshot of a company’s financial health. They are used to assess the financial performance of a company, and to make decisions about how to allocate resources. Financial statements provide information about a company’s assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses, and cash flow. They are used by investors, creditors, and other stakeholders to evaluate the financial health of a company.
===Types of Financial Statements === 
There are four main types of financial statements: the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and equity at a given point in time. The income statement shows a company’s revenues and expenses over a period of time. The cash flow statement shows the sources and uses of cash over a period of time. The statement of changes in equity shows the changes in a company’s equity over a period of time.
===Balance Sheet === 
The balance sheet is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and equity at a given point in time. It is used to assess the financial health of a company. The balance sheet is divided into two sections: assets and liabilities. Assets are resources owned by a company, such as cash, inventory, and property. Liabilities are obligations of a company, such as loans and accounts payable. Equity is the difference between assets and liabilities.
===Income Statement === 
The income statement is a financial statement that shows a company’s revenues and expenses over a period of time. It is used to assess the financial performance of a company. The income statement is divided into two sections: revenues and expenses. Revenues are the money a company earns from selling goods and services. Expenses are the costs associated with running a business, such as salaries, rent, and utilities.

The cash flow statement is a financial statement that shows the sources and uses of cash over a period of time. It is used to assess the liquidity of a company. The cash flow statement is divided into three sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Operating activities are the activities related to the day-to-day operations of a business, such as sales and purchases. Investing activities are the activities related to the purchase and sale of long-term assets, such as property and equipment.
