===Introduction to Financial Statements===

Financial statements are documents that provide a comprehensive overview of a company’s financial position. They are used to assess the financial health of a company and to make decisions about its future. Financial statements are typically prepared by a company’s accounting department and are used by investors, creditors, and other stakeholders to evaluate the company’s performance. Financial statements provide a snapshot of a company’s financial position at a given point in time and can be used to compare the company’s performance over time.

There are four main types of financial statements: the [[Balance Sheet|balance sheet]], the [[Income Statement|income statement]], the statement of [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]s, and the statement of changes in equity.

The income statement provides information about a company’s revenues and expenses over a given period of time.
