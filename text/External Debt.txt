===Types of External Debt===

External debt can be divided into two main categories: public debt and private debt.

Public debt can be further divided into two subcategories: long-term debt and short-term debt. Long-term debt is debt that is due to be paid back over a period of more than one year, while short-term debt is debt that is due to be paid back within one year.
