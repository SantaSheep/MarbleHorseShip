===Introduction to Fair Market Value===

Fair Market Value (FMV) is a term used in the financial world to describe the price of an asset or service that is determined by the forces of supply and demand in the open market. It is the price that a willing buyer and willing seller would agree upon in an arm’s length transaction. FMV is an important concept in the financial world, as it is used to determine the value of assets for tax purposes, as well as for the sale or purchase of assets.
===Definition of Fair Market Value===

Fair Market Value is the price that a willing buyer and willing seller would agree upon in an arm’s length transaction. It is the price that would be paid for an asset or service in an open market, taking into account all relevant factors such as supply and demand, market conditions, and the condition of the asset or service. FMV is not necessarily the same as the price that an asset or service is currently being sold for, as it takes into account all relevant factors.
===Factors Influencing Fair Market Value===

There are several factors that can influence the Fair Market Value of an asset or service. These include the supply and demand of the asset or service, the condition of the asset or service, the market conditions, and the availability of similar assets or services. The supply and demand of the asset or service will affect the price, as will the condition of the asset or service. Market conditions, such as the current economic climate, can also affect the price. Finally, the availability of similar assets or services can also influence the price.
===Examples of Fair Market Value===

One example of Fair Market Value is the sale of a house. The FMV of a house is determined by the forces of supply and demand in the open market, as well as the condition of the house, the market conditions, and the availability of similar houses. Another example of FMV is the sale of a car. The FMV of a car is determined by the forces of supply and demand in the open market, as well as the condition of the car, the market conditions, and the availability of similar cars.
