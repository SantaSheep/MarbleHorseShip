===Introduction to Inventory Turnover===

Inventory turnover is a measure of how quickly a company is able to sell its inventory. It is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the [[Average Inventory|average inventory]] for a given period. The higher the inventory turnover, the more efficiently a company is able to sell its inventory. This is important for businesses because it can help them determine how much inventory they need to keep on hand and how quickly they need to restock.
===Calculating Inventory Turnover===

Inventory turnover is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory for a given period. The formula for calculating inventory turnover is:

Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory

The cost of goods sold (COGS) is the total cost of the goods that were sold during a given period. This includes the cost of the goods, any shipping costs, and any other costs associated with the sale of the goods.

The average inventory is the average amount of inventory that a company has on hand during a given period. This can be calculated by taking the total inventory at the beginning of the period and the total inventory at the end of the period and dividing by two.
===Factors Affecting Inventory Turnover===

There are several factors that can affect a companyâ€™s inventory turnover. These include the type of products being sold, the pricing of the products, the availability of the products, and the demand for the products.

The type of products being sold can have a significant impact on inventory turnover. For example, if a company is selling products that are in high demand, they may be able to sell their inventory quickly. On the other hand, if a company is selling products that are not in high demand, they may have difficulty selling their inventory.

The pricing of the products can also have an impact on inventory turnover. If a company is selling products at a lower price than their competitors, they may be able to sell their inventory more quickly. On the other hand, if a company is selling products at a higher price than their competitors, they may have difficulty selling their inventory.

The availability of the products can also have an impact on inventory turnover. If a company is able to keep their products in stock, they may be able to sell their inventory more quickly. On the other hand, if a company is unable to keep their products in stock, they may have difficulty selling their inventory.

The demand for the products can also have an impact on inventory turnover. If a company is selling products that are in high demand, they may be able to sell their inventory quickly. On the other hand, if a company is selling products that are not in high demand, they may have difficulty selling their inventory.
