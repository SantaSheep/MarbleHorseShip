===Introduction to Ratified Random Sampling===

Ratified random sampling is a statistical sampling technique used to select a representative sample from a population. It is a type of stratified random sampling, which is a sampling method that divides the population into subgroups or strata, and then randomly selects a sample from each stratum. Ratified random sampling is a variation of stratified random sampling that adds an additional step of “ratifying” the sample to ensure that it is representative of the population. This technique is used in a variety of fields, including [[Market Research|market research]], public opinion polling, and medical research.
===History of Ratified Random Sampling===

The concept of stratified random sampling was first developed in the early 20th century by statistician W. Edwards Deming. Deming proposed that stratified random sampling could be used to improve the accuracy of sample surveys by ensuring that the sample was representative of the population. In the 1950s, statistician William Cochran developed the concept of ratified random sampling, which added an additional step of “ratifying” the sample to ensure that it was representative of the population.
===Benefits of Ratified Random Sampling===

Ratified random sampling has several advantages over other sampling techniques. First, it is a more accurate method of sampling than simple random sampling, as it ensures that the sample is representative of the population. Second, it is a more efficient method of sampling, as it requires fewer samples to achieve the same level of accuracy. Finally, it is a more cost-effective method of sampling, as it requires fewer resources to achieve the same level of accuracy.
===Challenges of Ratified Random Sampling===

Despite its advantages, ratified random sampling also has some drawbacks. First, it is a more complex method of sampling than simple random sampling, as it requires additional steps to ensure that the sample is representative of the population. Second, it is more time-consuming than other sampling techniques, as it requires additional steps to ensure that the sample is representative of the population. Finally, it is more expensive than other sampling techniques, as it requires additional resources to ensure that the sample is representative of the population.
===Conclusion===

In conclusion, ratified random sampling is a statistical sampling technique used to select a representative sample from a population. It is a more accurate, efficient, and cost-effective method of sampling than simple random sampling, but it is also more complex, time-consuming, and expensive. Ratified random sampling is used in a variety of fields, including market research, public opinion polling, and medical research
