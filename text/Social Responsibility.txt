Social responsibility is the idea that businesses should be held accountable for their actions and should strive to make a positive impact on society. This concept is based on the idea that businesses should not only be focused on making a profit, but should also be mindful of their impact on the environment, their employees, and the communities in which they operate. Social responsibility is often seen as a way for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to ethical and sustainable practices.
