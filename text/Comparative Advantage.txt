===Definition of Comparative Advantage === 
Comparative advantage is the ability of a country, business, or individual to produce a good or service at a lower cost than its competitors. This cost advantage is based on the country, business, or individual having access to resources, technology, or skills that are not available to its competitors. This cost advantage allows the country, business, or individual to produce the good or service at a lower cost than its competitors, thus giving it a competitive edge in the market.
===Examples of Comparative Advantage === 
One example of comparative advantage is the production of automobiles. In the United States, the cost of producing automobiles is lower than in other countries due to the availability of resources, technology, and skilled labor. This cost advantage allows the United States to produce automobiles at a lower cost than its competitors, thus giving it a competitive edge in the market. Another example of comparative advantage is the production of computer software. In India, the cost of producing computer software is lower than in other countries due to the availability of resources, technology, and skilled labor.
