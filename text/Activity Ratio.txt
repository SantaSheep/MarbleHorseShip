===Introduction to Activity Ratio===

Activity ratio is a financial metric used to measure the efficiency of a company’s operations. It is calculated by dividing a company’s total assets by its total sales. Activity ratio is used to measure the efficiency of a company’s operations and to compare the performance of different companies in the same industry. Activity ratio is also known as turnover ratio or [[Asset Turnover|asset turnover]] ratio.
===Types of Activity Ratios===

There are several types of activity ratios that can be used to measure the efficiency of a company’s operations. These include [[Inventory Turnover|inventory turnover]] ratio, [[Accounts Receivable|accounts receivable]] turnover ratio, [[[[Fixed Asset|Fixed Asset]] Turnover|fixed asset turnover]] ratio, and total asset turnover ratio.

Inventory turnover ratio measures the number of times a company’s inventory is sold and replaced over a given period of time. Accounts [[Receivable Turnover Ratio|receivable turnover ratio]] measures the number of times a company’s accounts receivable are collected over a given period of time. Fixed asset turnover ratio measures the number of times a company’s fixed assets are used to generate sales over a given period of time. Total asset turnover ratio measures the number of times a company’s total assets are used to generate sales over a given period of time.
===Calculating Activity Ratios===

Activity ratios are calculated by dividing a company’s total assets by its total sales. For example, if a company has total assets of $100,000 and total sales of $50,000, its activity ratio would be 2.0. This means that the company’s total assets are used to generate sales twice as often as its total sales.
===Interpreting Activity Ratios===

Activity ratios can be used to compare the performance of different companies in the same industry. A higher activity ratio indicates that a company is more efficient in using its assets to generate sales. A lower activity ratio indicates that a company is less efficient in using its assets to generate sales.
