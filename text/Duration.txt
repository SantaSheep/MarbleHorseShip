===Introduction to Duration - What is Duration?=== 
Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in interest rates. It is a measure of the time it takes for the bond’s price to adjust to a change in interest rates. Duration is expressed in years and is calculated by taking the weighted average of the present values of all the cash flows of a bond. The longer the duration, the more sensitive the bond’s price is to changes in interest rates.
===Calculating Duration - How to Calculate Duration=== 
Duration is calculated by taking the weighted average of the present values of all the cash flows of a bond. The present value of each cash flow is calculated by discounting it at the current interest rate. The weights are determined by the proportion of the present value of each cash flow to the total present value of all the cash flows. The longer the duration, the more sensitive the bond’s price is to changes in interest rates.
===Duration and Interest Rates - How Duration is Affected by Interest Rates=== 
Duration is affected by changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, the present value of the future cash flows of a bond decreases, and the bond’s price falls. The longer the duration, the more sensitive the bond’s price is to changes in interest rates.
===Duration and Bond Prices - How Duration is Affected by Bond Prices=== 
Duration is also affected by changes in bond prices. When the price of a bond rises, the present value of the future cash flows of the bond increases, and the duration of the bond increases. Conversely, when the price of a bond falls, the present value of the future cash flows of the bond decreases, and the duration of the bond decreases.
===Duration and Risk - How Duration Affects Risk=== 
Duration is also used to measure the risk of a bond. The longer the duration, the greater the risk of the bond. This is because the longer the duration, the more sensitive the bond’s price is to changes in interest rates.
===Conclusion - Summary of Duration and its Implications=== 
Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in interest rates. It is calculated by taking the weighted average of the present values of all the cash flows of a bond. Duration is affected by changes in interest rates, bond prices, and risk. The longer the duration, the more sensitive the bond’s price is to changes in interest rates, and the greater the risk of the bond.
