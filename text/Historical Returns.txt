===Introduction to Historical Returns===
Historical returns are a measure of the performance of an investment over a period of time. They are used to compare the performance of different investments and to assess the risk associated with an investment. Historical returns can be used to evaluate the performance of a portfolio, to determine the [[Expected Return|expected return]] of an investment, and to assess the risk associated with an investment.
===Definition of Historical Returns===
Historical returns are the returns that an investment has earned over a period of time. They are calculated by taking the total return of an investment over a period of time and dividing it by the initial investment. The total return includes any dividends, [[Capital Gain|capital gain]]s, and other income earned from the investment. Historical returns are expressed as a percentage and are used to compare the performance of different investments.
===Types of Historical Returns===
There are several different types of historical returns. The most common type of historical return is the total return, which includes any dividends, capital gains, and other income earned from the investment. Other types of historical returns include the price return, which only includes the change in the price of the investment, and the total return adjusted for inflation, which takes into account the effects of inflation on the investment.
===Calculating Historical Returns===
Calculating historical returns is relatively simple. The total return of an investment over a period of time is divided by the initial investment to calculate the historical return. For example, if an investment has earned a total return of 10% over a period of time and the initial investment was $1,000, the historical return would be 10%.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of Historical Returns===
Historical returns can be a useful tool for evaluating the performance of an investment. They can be used to compare the performance of different investments and to assess the risk associated with an investment. However, historical returns do not take into account any future changes in the market or the performance of the investment. Therefore, they should not be used as the sole basis for making an investment decision.
