It is the amount of money that a business has a right to receive from its customers for goods or services that have been delivered or used but not yet paid for. AR is an important part of a company’s financial health, as it is a source of cash flow and can be used to finance operations.

===Challenges of AR === 
One of the biggest challenges of AR is managing customer payments. It is important for businesses to have a system in place to track customer payments and ensure that they are paid on time. Additionally, businesses must be aware of any changes in customer payment habits, as this can have a significant impact on cash flow.
===Best Practices for AR === 
The best practices for AR include setting up a system to track customer payments, setting up payment reminders, and offering incentives for customers to pay on time. Additionally, businesses should be aware of any changes in customer payment habits and take steps to address any issues that arise.
