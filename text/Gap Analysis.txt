The second step is to identify the desired future state of the organization. This includes identifying the desired processes, procedures, and systems that should be in place. The third step is to compare the current state to the desired future state. This includes identifying the differences between the two states and the areas of improvement, opportunities, and risks. The fourth step is to develop strategies to bridge the gap between the two states. This includes developing strategies to improve processes, procedures, and systems, as well as strategies to mitigate risks.
