===Introduction to Pivot Point===

Pivot Point is a [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] tool used by traders to identify potential support and resistance levels in the market. It is based on the idea that the price of a security will tend to move in a certain direction after reaching a certain level. The pivot point is calculated by taking the average of the high, low, and closing prices of the previous trading day.

===Calculation of Pivot Point===

The calculation of the pivot point is relatively simple. The pivot point is calculated by taking the average of the high, low, and closing prices of the previous trading day. This average is then used to calculate the support and resistance levels for the current trading day. The support and resistance levels are calculated by adding and subtracting the average from the high and low of the previous day.
===Types of Pivot Points===

There are several different types of pivot points that can be used. The most common type is the standard pivot point, which is calculated using the average of the high, low, and closing prices of the previous trading day.

Each type of pivot point has its own set of rules for calculating the support and resistance levels.
