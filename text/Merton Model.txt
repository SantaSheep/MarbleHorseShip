===Introduction to the Merton Model === 
The Merton Model, also known as the Merton Structural Model, is a mathematical model developed by Robert C. Merton in 1974. It is used to evaluate the credit risk of a firm by analyzing the firm’s assets and liabilities. The model is based on the idea that a firm’s value is determined by the present value of its expected future cash flows. The model is used to calculate the probability of default of a firm and is widely used in the financial industry.
===Overview of the Model === 
The Merton Model is a mathematical model that is used to evaluate the credit risk of a firm. The model is based on the idea that a firm’s value is determined by the present value of its expected future cash flows. The model takes into account the firm’s assets, liabilities, and equity. The model is used to calculate the probability of default of a firm and is widely used in the financial industry.
===Assumptions of the Model === 
The Merton Model makes several assumptions in order to calculate the probability of default of a firm. These assumptions include: 
===Applications of the Model === 
• The firm’s assets and liabilities are assumed to be independent of each other. 
===Limitations of the Model === 
• The firm’s assets and liabilities are assumed to be homogeneous. 
===Conclusion=== 
The Merton Model is used to evaluate the credit risk of a firm. The model is used by financial institutions to assess the risk of a firm and to determine the probability of default. The model is also used by investors to assess the risk of investing in a firm. The model is also used by regulators to assess the risk of a firm and to ensure that the firm is compliant with regulations.
