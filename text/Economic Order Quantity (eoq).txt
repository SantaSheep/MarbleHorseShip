===Introduction to Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) === 
Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a model used to determine the optimal order quantity that a company should purchase to minimize the total cost of inventory. It is a tool used to determine the most cost-effective order size for a companyâ€™s inventory. The EOQ model takes into account the cost of ordering, the cost of holding inventory, and the cost of shortage. By using the EOQ model, companies can reduce their inventory costs and improve their overall profitability.
===Benefits of EOQ === 
The EOQ model provides a number of benefits to companies. It helps companies to reduce their inventory costs by determining the optimal order size. It also helps to reduce the risk of stockouts by ensuring that the right amount of inventory is ordered. Additionally, the EOQ model helps to reduce the amount of time spent on inventory management, as it eliminates the need to manually calculate the optimal order size.
===Calculating EOQ === 
The EOQ model is based on a number of variables, including the cost of ordering, the cost of holding inventory, and the cost of shortage. To calculate the EOQ, the following formula is used:
