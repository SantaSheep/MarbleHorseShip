===Introduction to Funded Debt === 
Funded debt is a type of debt that is secured by an asset or collateral. It is a loan that is backed by a tangible asset, such as a house, car, or other property. Funded debt is also known as secured debt, because the lender has the right to seize the asset if the borrower fails to make payments. Funded debt is a popular form of financing for businesses and individuals, as it offers a lower interest rate than unsecured debt.
===Types of Funded Debt === 
There are several types of funded debt, including mortgages, car loans, home equity loans, and student loans. Mortgages are the most common type of funded debt, as they are used to purchase a home. Car loans are used to purchase a vehicle, while home equity loans are used to finance home improvements or other large purchases. Student loans are used to finance a college education.
===Advantages of Funded Debt === 
The primary advantage of funded debt is that it offers a lower interest rate than unsecured debt. This is because the lender has the right to seize the asset if the borrower fails to make payments. Additionally, funded debt can be used to purchase large items, such as a home or car, that would otherwise be too expensive to purchase outright.
===Disadvantages of Funded Debt === 
The primary disadvantage of funded debt is that it can be difficult to obtain. This is because the lender must be confident that the borrower will be able to make payments on time. Additionally, if the borrower fails to make payments, the lender has the right to seize the asset. This can be a major financial burden for the borrower.
