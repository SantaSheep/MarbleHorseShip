===Introduction to Present Value===

Present value is a concept used in finance to determine the current value of a future [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]. It is used to compare the value of money today to the value of money in the future. Present value is calculated by discounting the future cash flow at a certain [[Rate Of Return|rate of return]]. This rate of return is known as the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]]. The discount rate is used to account for the [[Time Value Of Money|time value of money]], which states that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future due to inflation and other factors.
===Calculating Present Value===

The formula for calculating present value is as follows:

Present Value = Future Cash Flow / (1 + Discount Rate)^n

Where n is the number of periods in the future.

For example, if you have a future cash flow of $100 in one year and a discount rate of 10%, the present value would be $90.90.
