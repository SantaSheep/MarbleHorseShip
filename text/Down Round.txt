===Introduction to Downround===
A downround is a type of financing round in which the valuation of a company is lower than the valuation of the previous round. This type of financing round is typically used when a company is unable to raise capital at a higher valuation. Downrounds are a common occurrence in the [[Venture Capital|venture capital]] industry, and can have a significant impact on the company’s future prospects.
===Types of Downrounds===
There are two main types of downrounds: a “true” downround and a “false” downround. A true downround occurs when the company’s valuation is lower than the previous round. A false downround occurs when the company’s valuation is the same as the previous round, but the amount of capital raised is lower.
===Reasons for a Downround===
There are several reasons why a company may need to raise capital at a lower valuation. One of the most common reasons is that the company has not been able to meet its financial goals or has not been able to attract enough investors. Other reasons include a lack of investor confidence in the company’s business model, a decrease in the company’s market value, or a decrease in the company’s competitive advantage.
===Impact of a Downround===
The impact of a downround can be significant. For existing investors, a downround can result in a decrease in the value of their investment. For new investors, a downround can result in a lower return on their investment. Additionally, a downround can have a negative impact on the company’s ability to attract future investors, as investors may be wary of investing in a company that has had to lower its valuation.
