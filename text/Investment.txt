===Introduction to Investment===

Investment is the process of committing money or capital to an endeavor with the expectation of obtaining an additional income or profit. Investment is a key component of any financial plan, as it allows individuals to grow their wealth and achieve their financial goals. Investment can take many forms, from stocks and bonds to [[Real Estate|real estate]] and commodities. Each type of investment carries its own risks and rewards, and it is important to understand the different types of investments and their associated risks before investing.
===Types of Investment===

There are many different types of investments available to individuals. The most common types of investments include stocks, bonds, [[Mutual Fund|mutual fund]]s, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), real estate, commodities, and cash equivalents.

When you invest in a mutual fund, you are pooling your money with other investors and the fund manager will invest the money in a variety of stocks and bonds. Mutual funds are a popular way to diversify your investments and reduce risk.

Real estate is the purchase of land or buildings for the purpose of generating income or capital appreciation. Real estate can be a lucrative investment, but it also carries significant risks.

Commodities are physical goods such as oil, gold, and wheat. Commodities can be volatile and risky, but they can also provide significant returns over time.
