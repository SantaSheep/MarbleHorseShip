===Introduction to Cost Benefit Analysis===

Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) is a method of evaluating the costs and benefits of a project or decision. It is a tool used to determine whether a project or decision is worth pursuing or not. CBA is used to compare the costs and benefits of different options and to determine which option is the most cost-effective. It is a quantitative approach to decision-making that helps to identify the most efficient and effective way to achieve a desired outcome.
===Definition of Cost Benefit Analysis===

It is a tool used to compare the costs and benefits of different options and to determine which option is the most cost-effective. CBA is used to assess the economic feasibility of a project or decision by comparing the costs and benefits of each option. It is a quantitative approach to decision-making that helps to identify the most efficient and effective way to achieve a desired outcome.
===Benefits of Cost Benefit Analysis===

Cost Benefit Analysis is a useful tool for decision-making. It helps to identify the most cost-effective option and can be used to compare different options. CBA can also be used to assess the economic feasibility of a project or decision.
