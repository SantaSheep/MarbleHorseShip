===Introduction to M2 Money Supply === 
M2 money supply is a measure of the total amount of money in circulation in an economy. It is a broad measure of money supply that includes all forms of money, including cash, coins, and other forms of liquid assets. M2 money supply is an important indicator of economic activity and is closely watched by economists and central banks.
===Components of M2 Money Supply === 
M2 money supply is composed of several components, including currency in circulation, demand deposits, savings deposits, money market mutual funds, and other liquid assets. Currency in circulation includes all physical forms of money, such as coins and paper money. Demand deposits are funds held in checking accounts, while savings deposits are funds held in savings accounts. Money market mutual funds are investments that are highly liquid and can be quickly converted into cash. Other liquid assets include certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements, and travelerâ€™s checks.
===Factors Influencing M2 Money Supply === 
M2 money supply is influenced by a variety of factors, including the level of economic activity, the level of interest rates, and the level of government spending. When economic activity is high, people tend to spend more money, which increases the amount of money in circulation. When interest rates are low, people are more likely to save their money, which decreases the amount of money in circulation. Government spending also affects the money supply, as the government can increase or decrease the amount of money in circulation through its fiscal policies.
===Impact of M2 Money Supply on the Economy === 
M2 money supply has a significant impact on the economy. When the money supply is high, it can lead to inflation, as there is more money chasing the same amount of goods and services. This can lead to higher prices and a decrease in purchasing power. On the other hand, when the money supply is low, it can lead to deflation, as there is less money chasing the same amount of goods and services. This can lead to lower prices and an increase in purchasing power.

This includes currency in circulation, demand deposits, savings deposits, money market mutual funds, and other liquid assets.
