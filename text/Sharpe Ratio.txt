===Introduction to Sharpe Ratio===

The Sharpe Ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return that is used to evaluate the performance of an investment portfolio. It was developed by Nobel Prize-winning economist William F. Sharpe in 1966 and is widely used by investors and financial advisors to assess the performance of a portfolio relative to its risk. The Sharpe Ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free [[Rate Of Return|rate of return]] from the portfolio's return and dividing the result by the portfolio's [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]]. The higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better the portfolio's risk-adjusted return.
===History of Sharpe Ratio===

The Sharpe Ratio was developed by William F. Sharpe in 1966 as a way to measure the risk-adjusted return of an investment portfolio. Sharpe was a professor of finance at Stanford University and a Nobel Prize-winning economist. He developed the Sharpe Ratio as a way to measure the performance of a portfolio relative to its risk. The Sharpe Ratio has since become a widely used tool for evaluating the performance of an investment portfolio.
===Calculation of Sharpe Ratio===

The Sharpe Ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return from the portfolio's return and dividing the result by the portfolio's standard deviation. The risk-free rate of return is typically the yield on a 3-month U.S. [[Treasury Bill|Treasury bill]]. The portfolio's return is the average return of the portfolio over a given period of time. The portfolio's standard deviation is a measure of the portfolio's volatility. The higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better the portfolio's risk-adjusted return.
===Uses of Sharpe Ratio===

The Sharpe Ratio is used to evaluate the performance of an investment portfolio relative to its risk. It is a useful tool for investors and financial advisors to assess the performance of a portfolio and compare it to other portfolios. The Sharpe Ratio can also be used to compare the performance of different [[Asset Classes|asset classes]], such as stocks, bonds, and commodities.
===Limitations of Sharpe Ratio===

The Sharpe Ratio is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of an investment portfolio, but it has some limitations. The Sharpe Ratio does not take into account the costs associated with investing, such as transaction costs and taxes. It also does not take into account the risk of a portfolio, such as the risk of a portfolio losing money. Finally, the Sharpe Ratio does not take into account the time horizon of an investment, which can have a significant impact on the performance of a portfolio.
===Conclusion===

The Sharpe Ratio is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of an investment portfolio relative to its risk. It is a widely used measure of risk-adjusted return and is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return from the portfolio's return and dividing the result by the portfolio's standard deviation.
