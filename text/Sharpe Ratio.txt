===Introduction to Sharpe Ratio === 
Sharpe Ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return that is used to evaluate the performance of an investment portfolio. It was developed by Nobel Prize-winning economist William F. Sharpe in 1966 and is widely used by investors and financial advisors to assess the performance of a portfolio relative to its risk. The Sharpe Ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return from the portfolio’s return and dividing the result by the portfolio’s standard deviation. The higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better the portfolio’s risk-adjusted return.
===Calculating Sharpe Ratio === 
The Sharpe Ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return from the portfolio’s return and dividing the result by the portfolio’s standard deviation. The risk-free rate of return is typically the yield on a 3-month Treasury bill. The portfolio’s return is the average return of the portfolio over a given period of time. The portfolio’s standard deviation is a measure of the portfolio’s volatility.
===Benefits of Sharpe Ratio === 
The Sharpe Ratio is a useful tool for investors and financial advisors to assess the performance of a portfolio relative to its risk. It allows investors to compare the performance of different portfolios and make informed decisions about which portfolio is the best fit for their needs. The Sharpe Ratio also helps investors identify portfolios that are over- or under-performing relative to their risk.
===Limitations of Sharpe Ratio === 
The Sharpe Ratio is a useful tool, but it has some limitations. It does not take into account the time value of money, so it may not be an accurate measure of a portfolio’s performance over time. It also does not take into account the risk associated with individual investments, so it may not be an accurate measure of a portfolio’s risk-adjusted return.
===Examples of Sharpe Ratio === 
The Sharpe Ratio can be used to compare the performance of different portfolios. For example, if two portfolios have the same return but one has a higher Sharpe Ratio, it indicates that the portfolio with the higher Sharpe Ratio has a better risk-adjusted return.
===Conclusion === 
The Sharpe Ratio is a useful tool for investors and financial advisors to assess the performance of a portfolio relative to its risk. It allows investors to compare the performance of different portfolios and make informed decisions about which portfolio is the best fit for their needs. However, it has some limitations and should not be used as the sole measure of a portfolio’s performance.
