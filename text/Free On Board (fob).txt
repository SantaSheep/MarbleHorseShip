===Introduction to Free On Board (FOB) === 
Free On Board (FOB) is a term used in international trade to indicate when the responsibility of goods transfers from the seller to the buyer. It is an important concept in international trade, as it determines who is responsible for the goods during transit and who is liable for any damages or losses that may occur. FOB is also used to determine who is responsible for paying the freight and other related costs.
===Definition of FOB === 
FOB stands for “Free On Board” and is a term used in international trade to indicate when the responsibility of goods transfers from the seller to the buyer. It is an agreement between the buyer and seller that the seller will deliver the goods to a specified location, and the buyer will take responsibility for the goods from that point onward.
===Types of FOB === 
There are two main types of FOB: FOB Origin and FOB Destination. FOB Origin means that the seller is responsible for the goods until they reach the buyer’s designated port or place of delivery. FOB Destination means that the buyer is responsible for the goods from the point of delivery onward.
===Benefits of FOB === 
The main benefit of FOB is that it helps to clarify the responsibilities of both the buyer and seller in international trade. It also helps to reduce the risk of disputes between the two parties, as it clearly outlines who is responsible for the goods and who is liable for any damages or losses that may occur.
===Risks of FOB === 
The main risk of FOB is that it can be difficult to determine who is responsible for the goods during transit. If the goods are damaged or lost, it can be difficult to determine who is liable for the losses. Additionally, if the buyer and seller disagree on the terms of the FOB agreement, it can lead to costly disputes.
