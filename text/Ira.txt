===Introduction to IRA===

An Individual Retiremen[[T Account|t Account]] (IRA) is a type of retirement savings account that allows individuals to save for retirement on a tax-advantaged basis. IRAs are available to individuals who are not covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k). IRAs are also available to individuals who are covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan, but who wish to save additional funds for retirement. IRAs are regulated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and offer a variety of tax benefits.
===Types of IRAs===

There are several types of IRAs available to individuals. The most common types of IRAs are Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and SEP IRAs. Traditional IRAs are funded with pre-tax dollars and offer tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars and offer tax-free growth. SEP IRAs are employer-sponsored retirement plans that allow employers to make contributions to their employees’ retirement accounts.
===Benefits of an IRA===

IRAs offer a variety of benefits to individuals who are saving for retirement. IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, which means that the earnings on the investments in the account are not taxed until they are withdrawn. IRAs also offer tax-free growth, which means that the earnings on the investments in the account are not taxed at all. Additionally, IRAs offer the potential for higher returns than other types of retirement savings accounts, such as 401(k)s.
===Contribution Limits===

The IRS sets limits on the amount of money that can be contributed to an IRA each year. For 2020, the contribution limit for Traditional and Roth IRAs is $6,000, or $7,000 if you are age 50 or older. The contribution limit for SEP IRAs is 25% of the employee’s compensation, up to a maximum of $57,000.
===Withdrawal Rules===

The IRS sets rules for when and how funds can be withdrawn from an IRA. Generally, funds can be withdrawn from an IRA without penalty after the age of 59 ½. Funds can also be withdrawn from an IRA before the age of 59 ½, but may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Additionally, funds must begin to be withdrawn from an IRA after the age of 70 ½.
===Tax Implications===

The tax implications of an IRA depend on the type of IRA. Traditional IRAs are funded with pre-tax dollars and offer tax-deferred growth. This means that the earnings on the investments in the account are not taxed until they are withdrawn. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars and offer tax-free growth. This means that the earnings on the investments in the account are not taxed at all.
