===Introduction to Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) === 
Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) are long-term assets vital to business operations and not easily converted into cash. Examples of PP&E include buildings, machinery, furniture, land, and vehicles. These assets are used to produce goods and services and are recorded on the balance sheet at their historical cost.
===Accounting for PP&E === 
When accounting for PP&E, companies must record the cost of the asset, any associated costs, and any accumulated depreciation. The cost of the asset includes the purchase price, any taxes, and any installation or delivery costs. Companies must also record any associated costs, such as legal fees, permits, and other costs related to the acquisition of the asset. Finally, companies must record any accumulated depreciation, which is the amount of the asset’s value that has been used up over time due to wear and tear.
===Depreciation of PP&E === 
Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of an asset over its useful life. Companies use depreciation to spread out the cost of an asset over its useful life, rather than recording the entire cost in the year of purchase. Companies use different methods of depreciation, such as straight-line, double-declining balance, and sum-of-the-years’ digits.
===Impairment of PP&E === 
Impairment of PP&E occurs when the carrying value of an asset is greater than its fair value. When this occurs, companies must record an impairment loss on the income statement. Impairment losses are recorded when an asset’s fair value is lower than its carrying value due to changes in market conditions, technological advances, or other factors.
===Disposal of PP&E === 
When a company disposes of an asset, it must record a gain or loss on the income statement. The gain or loss is calculated by subtracting the net book value of the asset from the proceeds received from the sale. The net book value is the asset’s carrying value minus any accumulated depreciation.
===Example of PP&E Accounting=== 
Let’s say a company purchases a machine for $100,000. The company must record the purchase price of the machine, any associated costs, and any accumulated depreciation. The company must also record any depreciation expense over the useful life of the machine. If the machine is sold for $80,000, the company must record a gain or loss on the income statement. The gain or loss is calculated by subtracting the net book value of the machine (the carrying value minus any accumulated depreciation) from the proceeds received from the sale. In this case, the gain or loss would be $20,000.
