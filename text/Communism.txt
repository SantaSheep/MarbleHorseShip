===Introduction to Communism===
Communism is an economic and political system that is based on the idea of a classless society in which all property is owned by the community as a whole and all people are equal. It is a system of government in which the state owns all the means of production and distribution of goods and services. Communism is based on the principles of collectivism, which is the belief that the collective good of the people should be the primary focus of the government. Communism has been a major force in world politics since the early 20th century and has had a significant impact on the global economy.

This idea was further developed by Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks in Russia, who established the first communist state in 1917. Since then, communism has been adopted by many countries around the world, including China, Cuba, and North Korea.
