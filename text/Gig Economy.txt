The gig economy is a term used to describe the growing trend of people working in short-term, freelance, or contract-based jobs. This type of work is often referred to as the “gig” economy because it involves taking on short-term projects or tasks, rather than a traditional full-time job. The gig economy has become increasingly popular in recent years, as more and more people are looking for flexible work arrangements that allow them to work when and where they want.

The gig economy has been around for centuries, but it has become increasingly popular in recent years.
