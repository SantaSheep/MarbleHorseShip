===Introduction to Long-Term Liabilities===
Long-term liabilities are financial obligations that are due more than one year in the future. They are a type of debt that a company must pay back over a period of time. Long-term liabilities are typically used to finance large investments such as equipment, buildings, and other long-term assets. They are also used to finance operations and other activities that require a long-term commitment of resources.
===Types of Long-Term Liabilities===
Long-term liabilities can be divided into two main categories: secured and unsecured. Secured long-term liabilities are those that are backed by collateral, such as a mortgage or a loan. Unsecured long-term liabilities are those that are not backed by collateral and are usually more difficult to obtain. Examples of unsecured long-term liabilities include bonds, leases, and other contractual obligations.
