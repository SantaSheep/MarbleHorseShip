The GATT agreement was based on four main principles: non-discrimination, reciprocity, most-favored-nation treatment, and national treatment. The non-discrimination principle states that all countries should be treated equally and that no country should be given preferential treatment. The reciprocity principle states that countries should offer each other concessions in order to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers. The most-favored-nation treatment principle states that any concessions offered to one country should be offered to all countries. The national treatment principle states that imported goods should be treated the same as domestically produced goods.
===GATT Negotiations===
GATT negotiations were conducted in a series of rounds. The first round of negotiations was held in Geneva in 1947 and resulted in the reduction of tariffs on a range of products. Subsequent rounds of negotiations were held in Annecy (1949), Torquay (1950-51), Geneva (1956-57), and Tokyo (1973-79). These rounds resulted in further reductions in tariffs and other trade barriers.
