===Introduction to Onerous Contracts === 
Onerous contracts are a type of legal agreement that can be used to protect the interests of both parties involved in a transaction. Onerous contracts are often used in business transactions, such as the sale of goods or services, and can be used to protect both parties from potential losses. Onerous contracts are also used in other areas, such as real estate transactions, employment contracts, and other types of agreements.
===Definition of an Onerous Contract === 
An onerous contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties that imposes certain obligations on one or more of the parties involved. These obligations can include the payment of money, the performance of certain services, or the transfer of certain rights or assets. The obligations imposed by an onerous contract are usually more onerous than those imposed by a standard contract.
===Examples of Onerous Contracts === 
One example of an onerous contract is a lease agreement. A lease agreement is a legally binding agreement between a landlord and a tenant that outlines the terms of the rental agreement. The lease agreement typically includes the amount of rent to be paid, the length of the lease, and any other obligations that the tenant must fulfill.
