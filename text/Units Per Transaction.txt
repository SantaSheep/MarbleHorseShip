===Calculating Units Per Transaction===
Units per transaction (UPT) is calculated by dividing the total number of units sold in a given period of time by the total number of transactions in that same period. For example, if a business sold 100 units in 10 transactions, the UPT would be 10 units per transaction. UPT can be calculated for any period of time, such as a day, week, month, or year.
