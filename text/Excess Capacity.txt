===Introduction to Excess Capacity === 
Excess capacity is a situation in which a company produces more than what is necessary to meet the demand of its customers. It is a situation in which the company has more capacity than it needs to meet the current demand. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as overproduction, technological advances, or changes in the market. Excess capacity can have a significant impact on a company’s financial performance and can lead to decreased profits and increased costs.
===Causes of Excess Capacity === 
There are several causes of excess capacity. One of the most common causes is overproduction. This occurs when a company produces more than what is necessary to meet the demand of its customers. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as inaccurate forecasting, changes in the market, or technological advances. Another cause of excess capacity is technological advances. As technology advances, companies may find that their current production capacity is no longer sufficient to meet the demand of their customers. Finally, changes in the market can also lead to excess capacity. For example, if a company’s competitors enter the market and offer a better product or service, the company may find that its current production capacity is no longer sufficient to meet the demand of its customers.
===Impact of Excess Capacity on Businesses === 
Excess capacity can have a significant impact on a company’s financial performance. It can lead to decreased profits and increased costs. When a company has excess capacity, it may be forced to reduce its prices in order to remain competitive. This can lead to decreased profits as the company is not able to generate as much revenue as it would if it was able to sell its products at a higher price. Additionally, excess capacity can lead to increased costs as the company is forced to maintain and operate more production capacity than is necessary.
===Strategies to Reduce Excess Capacity === 
There are several strategies that companies can use to reduce excess capacity. One of the most common strategies is to reduce production. This can be done by reducing the number of products that are produced or by reducing the amount of time that is spent on each product. Additionally, companies can also reduce their production capacity by investing in new technology or by outsourcing production to other companies. Finally, companies can also reduce their production capacity by reducing their workforce or by reducing the number of hours that employees work.
===Examples of Excess Capacity ===

This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as inaccurate forecasting, changes in the market, or technological advances. Another example of excess capacity is when a company has invested in new technology but is unable to use it to its full potential. Finally, another example of excess capacity is when a company has a large workforce but is unable to utilize all of its employees.
