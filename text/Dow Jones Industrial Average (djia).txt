===Introduction to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) === 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 30 large, publicly traded companies in the United States. It is one of the oldest and most widely followed stock market indices in the world. The DJIA is a price-weighted index, meaning that the stocks with the highest prices have the greatest influence on the index. The index is calculated by taking the sum of the prices of the 30 stocks and dividing it by a divisor. The divisor is adjusted periodically to account for stock splits and other corporate actions.
===Historical Performance of the DJIA === 
The DJIA was first published in 1896 and has since become one of the most widely followed stock market indices in the world. Over the past century, the index has seen periods of both growth and decline. During the Great Depression, the index fell to its lowest level ever, bottoming out at 41.22 in July 1932. Since then, the index has recovered and has seen periods of strong growth. In August 1982, the index reached its highest level ever, closing at 11,722.98.
