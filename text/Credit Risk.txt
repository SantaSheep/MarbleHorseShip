===Introduction to Credit Risk === 
Credit risk is the potential for a borrower to default on a loan or other financial obligation. It is the risk that a borrower will not be able to repay the loan or other financial obligation. Credit risk is a major concern for lenders, investors, and other financial institutions. Credit risk can be caused by a variety of factors, including economic conditions, changes in the borrower’s financial situation, or changes in the borrower’s creditworthiness.
===Types of Credit Risk === 
There are several types of credit risk, including default risk, liquidity risk, and market risk. Default risk is the risk that a borrower will not be able to repay the loan or other financial obligation. Liquidity risk is the risk that a borrower will not be able to access the funds needed to repay the loan or other financial obligation. Market risk is the risk that changes in the market will affect the value of the loan or other financial obligation.
===Credit Risk Management Strategies === 
Credit risk management strategies are designed to reduce the risk of default and other credit risks. These strategies include diversifying the portfolio of loans, monitoring the creditworthiness of borrowers, and setting appropriate loan terms. Diversifying the portfolio of loans reduces the risk of default by spreading the risk across multiple borrowers. Monitoring the creditworthiness of borrowers helps to identify potential risks before they become a problem. Setting appropriate loan terms helps to ensure that the borrower is able to repay the loan.
===Credit Risk Measurement Techniques === 
Credit risk measurement techniques are used to measure the risk of default and other credit risks. These techniques include credit scoring, credit ratings, and stress testing. Credit scoring is a method of assessing the creditworthiness of a borrower by analyzing their credit history. Credit ratings are assigned to borrowers based on their creditworthiness. Stress testing is a method of assessing the potential impact of changes in the market on the value of a loan or other financial obligation.
===Credit Risk Mitigation Strategies === 
Credit risk mitigation strategies are designed to reduce the risk of default and other credit risks. These strategies include collateralizing the loan, setting appropriate loan terms, and diversifying the portfolio of loans. Collateralizing the loan reduces the risk of default by providing the lender with an asset that can be used to recover the loan if the borrower defaults. Setting appropriate loan terms helps to ensure that the borrower is able to repay the loan. Diversifying the portfolio of loans reduces the risk of default by spreading the risk across multiple borrowers.
===Example of Credit Risk in Action=== 
An example of credit risk in action is a borrower who defaults on a loan. In this case, the lender is at risk of not being able to recover the loan. The lender may be able to recover some of the loan by using collateral, but the risk of default still remains. The lender may also be able to reduce the risk of default by diversifying the portfolio of loans and setting appropriate loan terms.
