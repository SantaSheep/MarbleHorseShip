===Introduction to Credit Risk===

Credit risk is the risk of loss that arises from a borrower’s failure to make payments on any type of debt. It is the risk that a lender will not receive the principal and interest payments as agreed upon in the loan contract. Credit risk is a major concern for lenders, as it can lead to significant losses if not managed properly. Credit risk can be divided into two main categories: default risk and [[Liquidity Risk|liquidity risk]]. Default risk is the risk that a borrower will not be able to make payments on their loan, while liquidity risk is the risk that a borrower will not be able to access the funds they need to make payments.
===Types of Credit Risk===

• Counterparty risk: This is the risk that a borrower will not be able to fulfill their obligations under a loan agreement.

• Market risk: This is the risk that a borrower’s ability to repay a loan will be affected by changes in the market.

• Operational risk: This is the risk that a borrower’s operations will be affected by external factors, such as changes in regulations or technology.

• Reputational risk: This is the risk that a borrower’s reputation will be damaged due to their inability to meet their obligations.
