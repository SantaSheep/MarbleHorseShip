===Introduction to Central Limit Theorem (CLT) === 
The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental theorem in probability theory that states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables will tend to follow a normal distribution. This theorem is important in finance because it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of financial markets and the performance of investments.
===Overview of CLT === 
The Central Limit Theorem states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables will tend to follow a normal distribution. This means that the average of a large number of independent random variables will tend to be close to the mean of the distribution. The theorem also states that the variance of the sum of the random variables will be equal to the sum of the variances of the individual random variables. This means that the more random variables that are added, the more the distribution will tend to be normal.
===Examples of CLT in Finance === 
The Central Limit Theorem is used in finance to make predictions about the behavior of financial markets and the performance of investments. For example, the theorem can be used to predict the expected return of a portfolio of stocks. The expected return is calculated by taking the average of the returns of the individual stocks in the portfolio. The Central Limit Theorem states that the average of a large number of independent random variables will tend to be close to the mean of the distribution. This means that the expected return of a portfolio of stocks will tend to be close to the average return of the individual stocks in the portfolio.
===Benefits of CLT in Finance === 
The Central Limit Theorem is a powerful tool for making predictions about the behavior of financial markets and the performance of investments. The theorem allows us to make predictions about the expected return of a portfolio of stocks and the risk associated with the portfolio. The theorem also allows us to make predictions about the probability of certain events occurring in the financial markets.
===Limitations of CLT in Finance === 
The Central Limit Theorem is a powerful tool for making predictions about the behavior of financial markets and the performance of investments. However, the theorem has some limitations. The theorem assumes that the random variables are independent, which is not always the case in the real world. Additionally, the theorem assumes that the random variables are normally distributed, which is not always the case in the real world.
===Conclusion=== 
The Central Limit Theorem is a fundamental theorem in probability theory that states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables will tend to follow a normal distribution. This theorem is important in finance because it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of financial markets and the performance of investments. The theorem has some limitations, but it is still a powerful tool for making predictions about the expected return of a portfolio of stocks and the risk associated with the portfolio.
