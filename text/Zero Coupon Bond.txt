===Introduction to Zero-Coupon Bonds === 
Zero-coupon bonds are a type of debt security that does not pay periodic interest payments. Instead, the investor pays a discounted price for the bond and receives the full face value of the bond at maturity. Zero-coupon bonds are also known as deep discount bonds, accrual bonds, or discount bonds. They are issued by corporations, governments, and other entities and can be traded on the secondary market.
===Advantages of Zero-Coupon Bonds === 
Zero-coupon bonds offer several advantages to investors. They are relatively low-risk investments since they are backed by the issuer and the investor does not have to worry about fluctuating interest rates. They also offer the potential for higher returns than other types of fixed-income investments. Additionally, zero-coupon bonds are easy to buy and sell on the secondary market.
===Disadvantages of Zero-Coupon Bonds === 
Zero-coupon bonds also have some drawbacks. They are not as liquid as other types of investments, so it may be difficult to find a buyer if you need to sell the bond before maturity. Additionally, the investor does not receive any income from the bond until it matures, so the investor must be willing to wait for the full face value of the bond. Finally, zero-coupon bonds are subject to market risk, so the value of the bond may decrease if interest rates rise.
===How to Invest in Zero-Coupon Bonds === 
Zero-coupon bonds can be purchased directly from the issuer or through a broker. When purchasing directly from the issuer, the investor pays the discounted price for the bond and receives the full face value of the bond at maturity. When purchasing through a broker, the investor pays the full face value of the bond and receives the discounted price at the time of purchase.
===Tax Implications of Zero-Coupon Bonds === 
The tax implications of zero-coupon bonds depend on the type of bond and the investor’s tax situation. Generally, the investor must pay taxes on the difference between the discounted price paid for the bond and the full face value of the bond at maturity. This difference is known as the “accrued interest” and is taxed as ordinary income.
===Example of a Zero-Coupon Bond Investment=== 
For example, an investor purchases a zero-coupon bond with a face value of $10,000 for $7,000. At maturity, the investor will receive the full face value of the bond, $10,000. The difference between the discounted price paid for the bond and the full face value of the bond at maturity, $3,000, is considered “accrued interest” and is taxed as ordinary income.
