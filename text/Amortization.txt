===Introduction to Amortization===

Amortization is a financial term that refers to the process of spreading out the cost of a loan or other financial obligation over a period of time. It is a common practice in the banking and finance industry, and is used to reduce the amount of interest paid on a loan or other financial obligation. Amortization is also used to reduce the amount of taxes owed on a loan or other financial obligation.
===Types of Amortization===

There are two main types of amortization: straight-line amortization and accelerated amortization. Straight-line amortization is the most common type of amortization, and it involves making equal payments over the life of the loan or other financial obligation. Accelerated amortization involves making larger payments in the early years of the loan or other financial obligation, and smaller payments in the later years.
===Amortization Calculations===

The amount of each payment made in an [[Amortization Schedule|amortization schedule]] is determined by the amount of the loan or other financial obligation, the [[Interest Rate|interest rate]], and the length of the loan or other financial obligation. The interest rate is used to calculate the amount of interest that will be paid over the life of the loan or other financial obligation. The length of the loan or other financial obligation is used to determine the number of payments that will be made.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of Amortization===

Additionally, amortization can reduce the amount of interest paid on a loan or other financial obligation, as well as the amount of taxes owed.
