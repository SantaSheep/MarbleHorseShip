Compounding is the process of earning interest on interest. The effective interest rate is calculated by taking the nominal interest rate and adjusting it for the effects of compounding. The formula for calculating the effective interest rate is:

Effective Interest Rate = (1 + Nominal Interest Rate/Number of Compounding Periods)^Number of Compounding Periods - 1
===Advantages of Effective Interest===
