===Introduction to Enterprise Value===

Enterprise value (EV) is a measure of a company’s total value, including both its equity and debt. It is a measure of the value of a company as a whole, rather than just the value of its equity. EV is often used to compare companies of different sizes and to compare companies in different industries. It is also used to assess the value of a company in a merger or acquisition.
===Components of Enterprise Value===

EV is calculated by adding the [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] of a company’s equity to its total debt and subtracting its [[Cash And Cash Equivalents|cash and cash equivalents]]. Market capitalization is the total value of a company’s outstanding shares. Total debt includes both short-term and long-term debt. Cash and cash equivalents are [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]]s such as cash, [[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]], and short-term investments.

EV = Market Capitalization + Total Debt – Cash and Cash Equivalents

For example, if a company has a market capitalization of $100 million, total debt of $50 million, and cash and cash equivalents of $20 million, its EV would be $130 million.
