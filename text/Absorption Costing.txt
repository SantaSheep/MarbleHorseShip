===Introduction to Absorption Costing === 
Absorption costing is a method of accounting used to determine the cost of a product. It is a method of assigning both direct and indirect costs to a product. This method is used to determine the cost of a product for the purpose of pricing, inventory valuation, and cost control. It is also used to determine the cost of goods sold for financial reporting purposes.
===Definition of Absorption Costing === 
Absorption costing is a method of accounting that assigns both direct and indirect costs to a product. Direct costs are those costs that are directly related to the production of a product, such as materials and labor. Indirect costs are those costs that are not directly related to the production of a product, such as overhead costs.
===Examples of Absorption Costing === 
A common example of absorption costing is the cost of producing a car. The direct costs of producing a car include the cost of the materials used to make the car, the cost of the labor used to assemble the car, and the cost of the parts used to make the car. The indirect costs of producing a car include the cost of the factory rent, the cost of the utilities used to power the factory, and the cost of the administrative staff.
===Advantages of Absorption Costing === 
The main advantage of absorption costing is that it provides a more accurate picture of the cost of a product. By assigning both direct and indirect costs to a product, absorption costing provides a more accurate picture of the total cost of a product. This allows companies to better understand the cost of producing a product and to make more informed decisions about pricing and cost control.
===Disadvantages of Absorption Costing === 
The main disadvantage of absorption costing is that it can be difficult to accurately assign indirect costs to a product. It can be difficult to accurately assign overhead costs to a product, as overhead costs are often shared across multiple products. This can lead to inaccurate cost estimates and can lead to incorrect pricing decisions.
===Conclusion === 
Absorption costing is a method of accounting used to determine the cost of a product. It is a method of assigning both direct and indirect costs to a product. This method is used to determine the cost of a product for the purpose of pricing, inventory valuation, and cost control. It is also used to determine the cost of goods sold for financial reporting purposes. While absorption costing provides a more accurate picture of the cost of a product, it can be difficult to accurately assign indirect costs to a product.
