===Introduction to Variable Overhead Spending Variance===

[[Variable Overhead|Variable Overhead]] Spending Variance (VOSV) is a financial term used to measure the difference between actual and budgeted overhead spending. It is a key indicator of a company’s [[Financial Performance|financial performance]] and is used to identify areas of potential cost savings. VOSV is an important tool for financial managers to monitor and control overhead spending.
===Definition of Variable Overhead Spending Variance===

VOSV is defined as the difference between actual and budgeted overhead spending. It is calculated by subtracting the budgeted overhead spending from the actual overhead spending. The result is expressed as a percentage of the budgeted overhead spending.
===Components of Variable Overhead Spending Variance===

VOSV is composed of two components: fixed overhead spending variance and variable overhead spending variance. Fixed overhead spending variance is the difference between actual and budgeted fixed overhead spending. Variable overhead spending variance is the difference between actual and budgeted variable overhead spending.
===Calculating Variable Overhead Spending Variance===

VOSV is calculated by subtracting the budgeted overhead spending from the actual overhead spending. The result is expressed as a percentage of the budgeted overhead spending. For example, if the budgeted overhead spending is $100,000 and the actual overhead spending is $110,000, the VOSV is 10%.
===Examples of Variable Overhead Spending Variance===

VOSV can be used to identify areas of potential cost savings. For example, if the budgeted overhead spending is $100,000 and the actual overhead spending is $110,000, the VOSV is 10%. This indicates that the company is spending 10% more than budgeted on overhead. The company can then investigate the cause of the variance and take steps to reduce overhead spending.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of Variable Overhead Spending Variance===

The main advantage of VOSV is that it provides a quick and easy way to measure the difference between actual and budgeted overhead spending. This allows financial managers to identify areas of potential cost savings. The main disadvantage of VOSV is that it does not provide detailed information about the causes of the variance.
===Conclusion===

Variable Overhead Spending Variance (VOSV) is a financial term used to measure the difference between actual and budgeted overhead spending. It is composed of two components: fixed overhead spending variance and variable overhead spending variance. VOSV is calculated by subtracting the budgeted overhead spending from the actual overhead spending. It is a key indicator of a company’s financial performance and is used to identify areas of potential cost savings
