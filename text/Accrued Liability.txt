Accrued liabilities are also known as [[Accrued Expense|accrued expense]]s or accrued liabilities.
===Types of Accrued Liabilities===
Accrued liabilities can be divided into two main categories: short-term and long-term. Short-term accrued liabilities are those that are expected to be paid within one year, while long-term accrued liabilities are those that are expected to be paid over a longer period of time. Examples of short-term accrued liabilities include wages and salaries, taxes, and interest payments. Examples of long-term accrued liabilities include pension obligations, deferred taxes, and long-term debt.
