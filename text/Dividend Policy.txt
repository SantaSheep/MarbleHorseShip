===Types of Dividend Policies === 
Factors Influencing Dividend Policy - There are several factors that can influence a company's dividend policy. These include the company's financial performance, its cash flow, its capital structure, and its dividend history. Companies with strong financial performance and high cash flow are more likely to pay out higher dividends, while companies with weaker financial performance and lower cash flow are more likely to pay out lower dividends. The company's capital structure also plays a role in dividend policy, as companies with higher debt levels are more likely to pay out lower dividends. Finally, companies with a history of paying out higher dividends are more likely to continue doing so in the future.
