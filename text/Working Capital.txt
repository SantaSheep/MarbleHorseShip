===Introduction to Working Capital===

Working capital is a financial term used to describe the amount of money a business has available to cover its short-term expenses. It is the difference between a company’s [[Current Assets|current assets]] and its [[Current Liabilities|current liabilities]]. Working capital is an important measure of a company’s financial health and is used to assess its ability to pay its short-term obligations.
===Components of Working Capital===

Working capital is composed of two components: current assets and current liabilities. Current assets are assets that can be converted into cash within one year, such as cash, [[Accounts Receivable|accounts receivable]], inventory, and [[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]]. Current liabilities are obligations that must be paid within one year, such as [[Accounts Payable|accounts payable]], wages, taxes, and interest payments.
===Calculating Working Capital===

Working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. For example, if a company has $100,000 in current assets and $50,000 in current liabilities, its working capital would be $50,000.
===Advantages of Working Capital===

Working capital is important for businesses because it provides them with the funds they need to cover their short-term expenses. Having sufficient working capital allows businesses to pay their bills on time, purchase inventory, and invest in new projects. It also helps businesses maintain a healthy [[Cash Flow|cash flow]], which is essential for their long-term success.

Although working capital is important for businesses, it can also be a source of financial strain. If a business does not have enough working capital, it may be unable to pay its bills on time or invest in new projects. This can lead to cash flow problems and put the business at risk of insolvency.
