===Introduction to Random Variables===
Random variables are mathematical objects used to represent the outcomes of a random experiment. They are used to model the probability of certain events occurring and are used in a variety of fields, including finance, economics, and statistics. A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of a random experiment. The value of the random variable is determined by the outcome of the experiment. For example, if a coin is flipped, the random variable could be the number of heads that result from the flip.
===Types of Random Variables===
There are two main types of random variables: discrete and continuous. Discrete random variables are those that can take on only a finite number of values, such as the number of heads that result from a coin flip. Continuous random variables are those that can take on any value within a given range, such as the temperature of a room.
===Properties of Random Variables===
Random variables have several important properties that are used to describe them. These include the mean, variance, and [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]]. The mean is the average value of the random variable, the variance is a measure of how spread out the values of the random variable are, and the standard deviation is a measure of how far the values of the random variable are from the mean.
===Applications of Random Variables===
Random variables are used in a variety of fields, including finance, economics, and statistics. In finance, random variables are used to model the probability of certain events occurring, such as the price of a stock or the [[Rate Of Return|rate of return]] on an investment. In economics, random variables are used to model the behavior of consumers and the effects of certain policies. In statistics, random variables are used to model the probability of certain events occurring, such as the probability of a coin landing heads up.
