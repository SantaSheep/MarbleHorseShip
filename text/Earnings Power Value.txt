Earnings Power Value (EPV) is a financial valuation model used to estimate the intrinsic value of a company. It is based on the concept of discounted cash flow (DCF) and is used to determine the present value of a company’s future cash flows. EPV is a useful tool for investors to determine the fair value of a company and to compare it to its current market price.

The model takes into account the company’s current earnings, its expected growth rate, and the cost of capital. The EPV model is a variation of the discounted cash flow (DCF) model, which is used to estimate the present value of a company’s future cash flows.
