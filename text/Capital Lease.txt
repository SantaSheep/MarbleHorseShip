===Introduction to Capital Lease===

A capital lease is a type of lease agreement that allows a lessee to use an asset for a specified period of time in exchange for periodic payments. The lessee is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the asset, and the lessor retains ownership of the asset. Capital leases are often used to finance the purchase of large assets such as [[Real Estate|real estate]], vehicles, and equipment. The lease payments are typically structured to cover the cost of the asset, plus interest and other fees.
===Types of Capital Leases===

There are two main types of capital leases: finance leases and [[Operating Lease|operating lease]]s. Finance leases are long-term leases that allow the lessee to purchase the asset at the end of the lease term. The lessee is responsible for all maintenance and upkeep of the asset during the lease term. Operating leases are shorter-term leases that do not allow the lessee to purchase the asset at the end of the lease term. The lessor is responsible for all maintenance and upkeep of the asset during the lease term.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of Capital Leases===

Capital leases offer several advantages to both the lessee and the lessor. For the lessee, capital leases provide an opportunity to acquire an asset without having to make a large upfront payment. The lessee also has the option to purchase the asset at the end of the lease term. For the lessor, capital leases provide a steady stream of income and the ability to retain ownership of the asset.

However, capital leases also have some disadvantages. For the lessee, capital leases can be expensive due to the interest and other fees associated with the lease. Additionally, the lessee is responsible for all maintenance and upkeep of the asset during the lease term. For the lessor, capital leases can be risky since the lessee may not be able to make the payments or may not purchase the asset at the end of the lease term.
===Accounting Treatment of Capital Leases===

The accounting treatment of capital leases depends on the type of lease. For finance leases, the lessee must record the asset as an asset on the [[Balance Sheet|balance sheet]] and the lease payments as a liability. The lessee must also record depreciation expense for the asset over the life of the lease. For operating leases, the lessee must record the lease payments as an expense on the [[Income Statement|income statement]].
