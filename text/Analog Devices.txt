===History of Analog Devices===

Analog Devices was founded in 1965 by Ray Stata and Matthew Lorber in Norwood, Massachusetts. The company was initially focused on the design and manufacture of analog integrated circuits (ICs) for the industrial, automotive, and consumer markets. Over the years, ADI has grown to become one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies, with a presence in more than 40 countries and a customer base that spans the industrial, automotive, consumer, communications, and medical markets.

In the early years, ADI focused on the design and manufacture of analog ICs for the industrial, automotive, and consumer markets. In the late 1970s, ADI began to expand its product portfolio to include digital signal processing (DSP) ICs. In the 1980s, ADI began to focus on the development of mixed-signal ICs, which combine analog and digital functions on a single chip. In the 1990s, ADI began to focus on the development of high-performance analog ICs for the communications, medical, and industrial markets.
