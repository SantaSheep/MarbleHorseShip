===Introduction to Overall Liquidity Ratio===

The overall liquidity ratio is a financial metric used to measure a company’s ability to meet its short-term financial obligations. It is calculated by dividing a company’s total [[Current Assets|current assets]] by its total [[Current Liabilities|current liabilities]]. The overall liquidity ratio is also known as the [[Current Ratio|current ratio]] or the [[Working Capital|working capital]] ratio. It is an important indicator of a company’s financial health and is used by investors and creditors to assess the company’s ability to pay its short-term debts.
===Calculation of Overall Liquidity Ratio===

The overall liquidity ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s total current assets by its total current liabilities. Current assets are assets that can be converted into cash within one year, such as cash, [[Accounts Receivable|accounts receivable]], inventory, and [[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]]. Current liabilities are obligations that must be paid within one year, such as [[Accounts Payable|accounts payable]], short-term debt, and [[Accrued Expense|accrued expense]]s.

The overall liquidity ratio is expressed as a number, usually rounded to two decimal places. A ratio of 1.00 or higher indicates that the company has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities. A ratio of less than 1.00 indicates that the company does not have enough current assets to cover its current liabilities.
===Significance of Overall Liquidity Ratio===

The overall liquidity ratio is an important indicator of a company’s financial health. It is used by investors and creditors to assess the company’s ability to pay its short-term debts. A high overall liquidity ratio indicates that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities. This suggests that the company is in good financial health and is able to meet its short-term financial obligations.

A low overall liquidity ratio indicates that the company does not have enough current assets to cover its current liabilities. This suggests that the company is in poor financial health and may not be able to meet its short-term financial obligations.

The overall liquidity ratio is a useful indicator of a company’s financial health, but it has some limitations. It does not take into account the quality of the company’s assets or the timing of its liabilities. For example, a company may have a high overall liquidity ratio, but its assets may be of poor quality or its liabilities may be due in the near future.
