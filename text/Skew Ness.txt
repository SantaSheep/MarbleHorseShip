===Introduction to Skewness===

Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a [[Probability Distribution|probability distribution]]. It is a measure of the degree to which a distribution is not symmetrical. Skewness is used to describe the shape of a distribution and can be used to identify outliers or extreme values in a dataset. Skewness is an important concept in finance, as it can be used to identify potential risks and opportunities in the markets.
===Types of Skewness===

There are two types of skewness: positive skewness and negative skewness. Positive skewness occurs when the mean of the distribution is greater than the median, and the distribution has a long tail to the right. Negative skewness occurs when the mean of the distribution is less than the median, and the distribution has a long tail to the left.
===Calculating Skewness===

Skewness can be calculated using a variety of methods. The most common method is to calculate the skewness coefficient, which is the third standardized moment of the distribution. The skewness coefficient is calculated by subtracting the mean from the median, dividing by the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]], and then dividing by the cube root of the sample size.
===Examples of Skewness===

Skewness can be seen in many different types of distributions. For example, the distribution of stock returns is often positively skewed, meaning that there are more extreme positive returns than extreme [[Negative Return|negative return]]s. Similarly, the distribution of bond returns is often negatively skewed, meaning that there are more extreme negative returns than extreme positive returns.
===Impact of Skewness on Financial Markets===

Skewness can have a significant impact on [[Financial Market|financial market]]s. Positively skewed distributions can lead to higher levels of risk, as there is a greater chance of extreme positive returns. Conversely, negatively skewed distributions can lead to lower levels of risk, as there is a greater chance of extreme negative returns. As such, skewness can be used to identify potential risks and opportunities in the markets.
===Conclusion===

In conclusion, skewness is an important concept in finance, as it can be used to identify potential risks and opportunities in the markets. Skewness can be calculated using a variety of methods, and it can be seen in many different types of distributions. Positively skewed distributions can lead to higher levels of risk, while negatively skewed distributions can lead to lower levels of risk. As such, skewness is an important concept for investors to understand
