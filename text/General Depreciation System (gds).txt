===Introduction to General Depreciation System (GDS) === 
The General Depreciation System (GDS) is a method of accounting for the depreciation of tangible assets over their useful life. It is used by businesses to calculate the amount of depreciation expense to be reported on their financial statements. GDS is one of the two methods of accounting for depreciation, the other being the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS).
===Benefits of GDS === 
The primary benefit of GDS is that it allows businesses to accurately calculate the amount of depreciation expense to be reported on their financial statements. This helps businesses to accurately report their financial performance and to make informed decisions about their investments. Additionally, GDS allows businesses to spread out the cost of an asset over its useful life, which can help to reduce the amount of taxes they owe.
===How GDS Works === 
GDS works by assigning a useful life to an asset and then calculating the amount of depreciation expense to be reported each year. The useful life of an asset is determined by the type of asset and its expected usage. For example, a computer may have a useful life of five years, while a car may have a useful life of ten years.
===Calculating GDS Depreciation === 
The amount of depreciation expense to be reported each year is calculated by dividing the cost of the asset by its useful life. For example, if a computer costs $1,000 and has a useful life of five years, the amount of depreciation expense to be reported each year would be $200 ($1,000 divided by 5).
===Examples of GDS Depreciation === 
To illustrate how GDS works, letâ€™s look at two examples. In the first example, a business purchases a computer for $1,000 and assigns it a useful life of five years. The amount of depreciation expense to be reported each year would be $200 ($1,000 divided by 5). In the second example, a business purchases a car for $20,000 and assigns it a useful life of ten years. The amount of depreciation expense to be reported each year would be $2,000 ($20,000 divided by 10).
===Conclusion=== 
The General Depreciation System (GDS) is a method of accounting for the depreciation of tangible assets over their useful life. It is used by businesses to calculate the amount of depreciation expense to be reported on their financial statements. GDS allows businesses to accurately calculate the amount of depreciation expense to be reported each year and to spread out the cost of an asset over its useful life. By understanding how GDS works and its benefits, businesses can make informed decisions about their investments and accurately report their financial performance.
