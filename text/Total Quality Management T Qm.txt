===Introduction to Total Quality Management (TQM)===
Total [[Quality Management|Quality Management]] (TQM) is a management approach that focuses on the continuous improvement of products and services by involving all members of an organization in the process. It is a system of management that seeks to ensure that all activities within an organization are conducted in a manner that meets or exceeds customer expectations. TQM is based on the idea that quality is the responsibility of everyone in the organization, from the top management to the lowest level employees.
===History of TQM===
The concept of Total Quality Management (TQM) was first developed in the 1950s by W. Edwards Deming, an American statistician and management consultant. Deming believed that quality was the responsibility of everyone in the organization, from the top management to the lowest level employees. He also believed that quality should be built into the product or service from the beginning, rather than being inspected and tested after the fact. Deming's ideas were adopted by Japanese companies in the 1960s and 1970s, and the concept of TQM was born.
===Benefits of TQM===
The implementation of TQM can bring many benefits to an organization. These include improved customer satisfaction, increased efficiency, reduced costs, improved employee morale, and increased profits. TQM also encourages innovation and creativity, as employees are encouraged to think of new ways to improve the quality of products and services.
===Implementing TQM===
 requires a commitment from all levels of the organization. The first step is to create a quality policy that outlines the organization's commitment to quality. This policy should be communicated to all employees and should be reviewed and updated regularly. The next step is to create a quality management system that outlines the processes and procedures that will be used to ensure quality. This system should be documented and communicated to all employees. Finally, the organization should create a quality assurance program that outlines the methods and tools that will be used to measure and monitor quality.
===Challenges of TQM===
Implementing TQM can be a challenge for many organizations. One of the biggest challenges is getting all employees to buy into the concept of TQM and to understand their role in the process. Another challenge is finding the resources and time to implement the system. Finally, it can be difficult to measure the success of TQM, as it is often difficult to quantify the benefits of improved quality.
