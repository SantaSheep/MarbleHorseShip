===Introduction to Put-Call Parity===
Put-call parity is a fundamental principle of financial economics that states that the price of a [[Call Option|call option]] and a [[Put Option|put option]] with the same [[Strike Price|strike price]] and expiration date must be equal. Put-call parity is an important concept in the pricing of options and derivatives, and is used to determine the [[Fair Value|fair value]] of options and derivatives. Put-call parity is also used to identify arbitrage opportunities in the options and derivatives markets.
===Definition of Put-Call Parity===
Put-call parity is a relationship between the price of a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date. Put-call parity states that the price of a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date must be equal. Put-call parity is based on the idea that the price of a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date should be equal, as they are both derivatives of the same underlying asset.
===Examples of Put-Call Parity===
Put-call parity can be used to identify arbitrage opportunities in the options and derivatives markets. For example, if the price of a call option is higher than the price of a put option with the same strike price and expiration date, then an arbitrageur could buy the call option and sell the put option to make a risk-free profit.
===Advantages of Put-Call Parity===
Put-call parity is an important concept in the pricing of options and derivatives, and is used to determine the fair value of options and derivatives. Put-call parity is also used to identify arbitrage opportunities in the options and derivatives markets. Put-call parity can also be used to hedge against risk in the options and derivatives markets.
===Disadvantages of Put-Call Parity===
Put-call parity is based on the assumption that the underlying asset is not subject to any changes in price or volatility. If the underlying asset does experience changes in price or volatility, then the put-call parity may no longer hold. Additionally, put-call parity does not take into account the cost of carrying the underlying asset, which can affect the price of the options and derivatives.
===Conclusion===
Put-call parity is an important concept in the pricing of options and derivatives, and is used to determine the fair value of options and derivatives. Put-call parity is also used to identify arbitrage opportunities in the options and derivatives markets. Put-call parity can also be used to hedge against risk in the options and derivatives markets. However, put-call parity is based on the assumption that the underlying asset is not subject to any changes in price or volatility, and does not take into account the cost of carrying the underlying asset
