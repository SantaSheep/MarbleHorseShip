===Introduction to Unit Cost === 
Unit cost is a measure of the cost of a single unit of a product or service. It is calculated by dividing the total cost of the product or service by the number of units produced or provided. Unit cost is an important tool for businesses to understand the cost of their products and services, and to make decisions about pricing and production.
===Calculating Unit Cost === 
Unit cost is calculated by dividing the total cost of the product or service by the number of units produced or provided. For example, if a company produces 100 widgets at a total cost of $500, the unit cost of each widget is $5. This calculation can be used to compare the cost of different products or services, or to determine the cost of producing a certain number of units.
===Benefits of Unit Cost Analysis === 
Unit cost analysis can be used to compare the cost of different products or services, or to determine the cost of producing a certain number of units. It can also be used to identify areas where costs can be reduced, or to determine the most cost-effective production methods. Unit cost analysis can also help businesses to set prices that are competitive and profitable.
===Examples of Unit Cost Calculations === 
Unit cost calculations can be used to compare the cost of different products or services. For example, a company may compare the cost of producing 100 widgets at a total cost of $500 to the cost of producing 200 widgets at a total cost of $1000. The unit cost of each widget in the first case is $5, while the unit cost of each widget in the second case is $5. This comparison can help the company determine which production method is more cost-effective.
