===Definition of Shortsqueeze===
A short squeeze is a situation in which a heavily shorted stock experiences a sudden and sharp increase in price. This is usually caused by a positive news announcement, a change in market sentiment, or a short covering rally. When a short squeeze occurs, it can have a significant impact on the stock price and the market as a whole.

There are several potential causes of a short squeeze.

This occurs when short sellers buy back the stock they have sold in order to close out their positions, driving up the price and squeezing out other short sellers.
