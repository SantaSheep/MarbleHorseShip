===Introduction to McDonald’s===

McDonald’s is one of the world’s most recognizable and successful fast-food chains. Founded in 1940 by brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald, the company has grown to become the largest fast-food chain in the world, with more than 36,000 locations in over 100 countries. McDonald’s is known for its iconic golden arches logo, its signature Big Mac sandwich, and its commitment to providing customers with a consistent, high-quality experience.

===History of McDonald’s===

McDonald’s began as a small drive-in restaurant in San Bernardino, California, in 1940. The brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald opened the restaurant with the intention of providing customers with a quick and convenient way to get a meal. The restaurant quickly became popular, and the brothers began to expand their business. In 1948, they introduced the Speedee Service System, which allowed customers to order their food quickly and efficiently. This system was the precursor to the modern fast-food restaurant.

In 1955, the McDonald brothers sold their business to Ray Kroc, who had been impressed by the brothers’ success. Kroc was a visionary entrepreneur who saw the potential of the McDonald’s brand and wanted to expand it. He opened the first McDonald’s franchise in Des Plaines, Illinois, in 1955. Kroc continued to expand the business, and by the end of the 1960s, McDonald’s had become a global phenomenon.
