Tapering is a tool that is used by central banks to manage the [[Money Supply|money supply]] and to control inflation.
===History of Tapering===
Tapering has been used by central banks since the early 20th century. The first instance of tapering was in the United States in the 1920s, when the Federal Reserve began to reduce the amount of money it was injecting into the economy. This was done in order to slow down the rate of economic growth and to prevent inflation from getting out of control. Since then, tapering has been used by central banks around the world to manage the money supply and to control inflation.
===Types of Tapering===
There are two main types of tapering: [[Quantitative Easing|quantitative easing]] (QE) and [[Open Market Operations|open market operations]] (OMO). Quantitative easing is a form of monetary policy in which a central bank purchases government bonds and other [[Financial Asset|financial asset]]s in order to increase the money supply and stimulate the economy.

It can also help to reduce the risk of asset bubbles by reducing the amount of money that is available for speculation. Finally, tapering can help to reduce the risk of a financial crisis by reducing the amount of money that is available for lending.
===Drawbacks of Tapering===
Tapering can also have some drawbacks. It can lead to a decrease in economic growth, as the reduction [[In The Money|in the money]] supply can lead to a decrease in consumer spending. It can also lead to an increase in unemployment, as businesses may be forced to lay off workers due to the decrease in demand for their products.

===Conclusion===
Tapering is a tool that is used by central banks to manage the money supply and to control inflation. It has both benefits and drawbacks, and it is important for central banks to carefully consider the potential effects of tapering before implementing it.
