It provides an indication of a company’s liquidity and ability to pay its short-term debts. A high acid-test ratio indicates that a company is in good financial health and is able to pay its short-term debts.
===Limitations of the Acid-Test Ratio === 
The acid-test ratio is a useful tool, but it has some limitations. It does not take into account long-term debt or other liabilities, such as taxes or deferred revenue. It also does not take into account the quality of the assets or the company’s ability to generate cash flow.
