===Introduction to Straddle===

Straddle is a financial term that refers to a trading strategy used by investors to profit from price movements in a security. It involves simultaneously buying and selling options of the same underlying asset at the same [[Strike Price|strike price]] and expiration date. The strategy is used to capitalize on the volatility of the underlying asset and can be used to hedge against risk or to speculate on the direction of the asset’s price.
===Definition of Straddle===

A straddle is a trading strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling options of the same underlying asset at the same strike price and expiration date. The strategy is used to capitalize on the volatility of the underlying asset and can be used to hedge against risk or to speculate on the direction of the asset’s price. The investor will typically buy a [[Call Option|call option]] and a [[Put Option|put option]] with the same strike price and expiration date. If the price of the underlying asset moves significantly in either direction, the investor will be able to profit from the options.
===Types of Straddles===

There are two main types of straddles: long straddles and short straddles. A long straddle involves buying both a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date. A short straddle involves selling both a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of Straddles===

Straddles can be a useful tool for investors looking to capitalize on the volatility of the underlying asset. The strategy allows investors to profit from price movements in either direction, and can be used to hedge against risk or to speculate on the direction of the asset’s price. However, straddles can be risky and can result in losses if the price of the underlying asset does not move significantly in either direction.
===Examples of Straddles===

An example of a long straddle would be an investor buying a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date. The investor is betting that the price of the underlying asset will move significantly in either direction, allowing them to profit from the options. An example of a short straddle would be an investor selling a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date. The investor is betting that the price of the underlying asset will not move significantly in either direction, allowing them to profit from the options.
