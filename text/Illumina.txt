===Introduction to Illumina===
Illumina is a leading biotechnology company that specializes in the development, manufacture, and commercialization of innovative sequencing and array-based technologies for genetic analysis. Founded in 1998, Illumina has become a leader in the field of genomics, providing products and services that enable researchers to explore biological systems at a molecular level. Illumina’s products and services are used in a variety of applications, including clinical diagnostics, agricultural biotechnology, and drug discovery. Illumina’s mission is to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome.
===History of Illumina===
Illumina was founded in 1998 by Dr. David Walt and Dr. John Stuelpnagel. The company was initially focused on developing and commercializing DNA sequencing technology. In 2000, Illumina acquired Solexa, a company that had developed a new sequencing technology based on the use of single-molecule fluorescent sequencing. This technology allowed for the sequencing of longer DNA strands than was previously possible. In 2003, Illumina launched its first commercial sequencing system, the Genome Analyzer. Since then, Illumina has continued to develop and commercialize new sequencing technologies, including the HiSeq and MiSeq systems.
===Illumina’s Business Model===
Illumina’s business model is based on the sale of sequencing systems, consumables, and services. The company’s sequencing systems are sold to research institutions, clinical laboratories, and other customers. Illumina also sells consumables, such as reagents and kits, which are used in conjunction with its sequencing systems. In addition, Illumina provides a range of services, including sequencing services, data analysis services, and bioinformatics services.
