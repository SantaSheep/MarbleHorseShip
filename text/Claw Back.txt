===Introduction to Clawback===
Clawback is a term used to describe the process of recovering funds from an individual or entity that has received them in an improper or illegal manner. It is a form of financial regulation that is used to protect investors and other stakeholders from fraud and other financial misdeeds. Clawback is a tool used by governments, corporations, and other organizations to ensure that funds are not misused or misappropriated.
===Types of Clawback===
There are several different types of clawback that can be used in different situations. The most common type of clawback is a contractual clawback, which is used when an individual or entity has received funds in violation of a contract. This type of clawback is typically used to recover funds that have been improperly received or used. Other types of clawback include statutory clawback, which is used to recover funds that have been received in violation of a law or regulation, and voluntary clawback, which is used when an individual or entity voluntarily returns funds that have been received in an improper manner.
===Clawback in Practice===
Clawback is often used in the corporate world to protect investors and other stakeholders from fraud and other financial misdeeds. For example, if a company has received funds from an investor in violation of a contract, the company may use a contractual clawback to recover the funds.

For example, if a government agency has received funds from a taxpayer in violation of a law or regulation, the agency may use a statutory clawback to recover the funds.
