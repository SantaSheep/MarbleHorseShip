Funds from operations (FFO) is a financial metric used to measure the performance of a real estate investment trust (REIT). It is a measure of the cash flow generated by a REIT’s operations and is used to assess the financial health of the company.

FFO also provides investors with an indication of the REIT’s ability to generate cash flow from its operations.
===Challenges of FFO === 
Although FFO is a useful metric for investors to consider when evaluating a REIT’s performance, it is not without its challenges. FFO does not take into account the REIT’s debt obligations, which can have a significant impact on the REIT’s financial health. Additionally, FFO does not take into account the REIT’s capital expenditures, which can also have a significant impact on the REIT’s financial health.
