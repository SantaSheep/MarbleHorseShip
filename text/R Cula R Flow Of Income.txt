===Introduction to Circular Flow of Income===

Circular flow of income is an economic model that illustrates the movement of money between different sectors of an economy. It is a visual representation of the exchange of goods and services between households and businesses, and the payments made in return for those goods and services. The circular flow of income is a key concept in macroeconomics, as it helps to explain how an economy functions and how [[Economic Growth|economic growth]] is achieved.
===Components of Circular Flow of Income===

The circular flow of income consists of two main components: the real flow of goods and services, and the money flow of payments for those goods and services. The real flow of goods and services is the exchange of goods and services between households and businesses. This is the production side of the economy, where households provide the labor and businesses provide the capital and other resources needed to produce goods and services. The money flow of payments is the exchange of money between households and businesses. This is the consumption side of the economy, where households purchase the goods and services produced by businesses.
===Examples of Circular Flow of Income===

A simple example of the circular flow of income is the exchange of goods and services between a farmer and a grocery store. The farmer produces the goods (e.g. vegetables, fruits, etc.) and the grocery store purchases them. The farmer receives money in return for the goods, and the grocery store receives the goods. This exchange of goods and services is an example of the real flow of goods and services. The money flow of payments is the exchange of money between the farmer and the grocery store. The farmer receives money for the goods, and the grocery store pays money for the goods.
