===Introduction to Elasticity === 
Elasticity is a concept in economics that measures the responsiveness of one economic variable to changes in another. It is used to measure the degree to which a change in one variable will cause a change in another. Elasticity is an important concept in economics because it helps to explain how changes in one variable will affect other variables in the economy.
===Price Elasticity of Demand === 
Price elasticity of demand is a measure of how responsive the quantity demanded of a good or service is to a change in its price. It is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity demanded by the percentage change in price. If the price elasticity of demand is greater than one, then the demand for the good or service is said to be elastic. If the price elasticity of demand is less than one, then the demand for the good or service is said to be inelastic.
===Income Elasticity of Demand === 
Income elasticity of demand is a measure of how responsive the quantity demanded of a good or service is to a change in income. It is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity demanded by the percentage change in income. If the income elasticity of demand is greater than one, then the demand for the good or service is said to be income elastic. If the income elasticity of demand is less than one, then the demand for the good or service is said to be income inelastic.
===Cross Elasticity of Demand === 
Cross elasticity of demand is a measure of how responsive the quantity demanded of one good or service is to a change in the price of another good or service. It is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity demanded of one good or service by the percentage change in the price of another good or service. If the cross elasticity of demand is greater than one, then the demand for the good or service is said to be cross elastic. If the cross elasticity of demand is less than one, then the demand for the good or service is said to be cross inelastic.
===Examples of Elasticity === 
Examples of elasticity include the price elasticity of demand for gasoline, the income elasticity of demand for luxury goods, and the cross elasticity of demand between coffee and tea.
===Conclusion=== 
Elasticity is an important concept in economics that measures the responsiveness of one economic variable to changes in another. It is used to measure the degree to which a change in one variable will cause a change in another. There are several types of elasticity, including price elasticity of demand, income elasticity of demand, and cross elasticity of demand. Examples of elasticity include the price elasticity of demand for gasoline, the income elasticity of demand for luxury goods, and the cross elasticity of demand between coffee and tea.
