===Introduction to Liquidity===

Liquidity is a term used to describe the ability of an asset or security to be converted into cash quickly and without significant loss of value.

Funding liquidity, on the other hand, refers to the ability of an entity to access funds quickly and without significant cost. This is determined by the availability of credit and other sources of funding.
===Factors Affecting Liquidity===

There are several factors that can affect the liquidity of an asset or security. These include the size of the market, the number of buyers and sellers, the bid-ask spread, the availability of credit, and the overall economic environment.
