===Introduction to Laissezfaire===

Laissezfaire is an economic system that is based on the idea of minimal government intervention in the economy. It is a French term that literally translates to “let do” or “leave alone” and is often used to describe a hands-off approach to economic policy. Laissezfaire is based on the belief that the [[Free Market|free market]] should be allowed to operate without government interference, and that the market will naturally adjust to supply and demand.
===History of Laissezfaire===

The concept of Laissezfaire has its roots in the writings of the French Physiocrats in the 18th century. The Physiocrats believed that the economy should be left to its own devices and that government intervention should be kept to a minimum. This idea was further developed by the classical economists of the 19th century, such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, who argued that the free market should be allowed to operate without government interference.
===Principles of Laissezfaire===

The main principle of Laissezfaire is that the government should not interfere in the economy. This means that the government should not impose taxes, regulations, or tariffs on businesses or individuals. Instead, the government should allow the free market to operate without interference. This means that businesses should be allowed to compete freely and that prices should be determined by the forces of supply and demand.
===Examples of Laissezfaire===

One of the most famous examples of Laissezfaire is the United States in the 19th century. During this period, the US government adopted a hands-off approach to economic policy, allowing businesses to compete freely and prices to be determined by the forces of supply and demand. This resulted in a period of rapid [[Economic Growth|economic growth]] and development.

Critics of Laissezfaire argue that it can lead to economic inequality and exploitation. They argue that without government intervention, businesses can take advantage of workers and consumers, leading to unfair wages and prices. They also argue that without government intervention, the economy can become unstable and prone to boom and bust cycles.
