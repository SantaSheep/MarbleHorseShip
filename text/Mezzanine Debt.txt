===Introduction to Mezzanine Debt===

It is a hybrid of debt and equity, and is typically used when a company is unable to obtain traditional financing from banks or other lenders. Mezzanine debt is a form of [[Subordinated Debt|subordinated debt]], meaning that it is subordinate to other forms of debt, such as senior debt. It is also typically unsecured, meaning that it does not have any collateral backing it up.

===Types of Mezzanine Debt===
Mezzanine debt can come in a variety of forms, including convertible debt, [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], and warrants. Convertible debt is a type of debt that can be converted into equity at a later date.

For example, mezzanine debt can be structured as a loan, with the lender receiving interest payments and a portion of the company’s profits. It can also be structured as a convertible debt, with the lender receiving a portion of the company’s equity in exchange for the loan. Additionally, mezzanine debt can be structured as a warrant, with the lender receiving the right to purchase a certain number of shares of stock at a predetermined price.
