The standards are designed to provide a consistent and transparent framework for financial reporting, allowing investors and other stakeholders to make informed decisions.
===History of IFRS===

The IASB was established in 2001 as a successor to the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). The IASC was formed in 1973 to develop a set of international accounting standards that could be used by companies around the world. The IASC issued its first set of standards in 1989, and these standards were revised and updated over the years. In 2001, the IASB was established to take over the responsibility of developing and maintaining the standards.
===Adoption of IFRS===

The adoption of IFRS has been a gradual process. In 2005, the European Union adopted IFRS as its official accounting standards, and many other countries have followed suit. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has allowed companies to use IFRS for their financial reporting since 2007. The SEC has also proposed a roadmap for the full adoption of IFRS in the United States by 2020.
