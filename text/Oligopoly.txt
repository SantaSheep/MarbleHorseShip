===Introduction to Oligopoly - Definition and Examples === 
Oligopoly is a market structure in which a few firms dominate the industry. It is characterized by a small number of large firms that control the majority of the market share. The firms in an oligopoly are interdependent, meaning that the actions of one firm will affect the other firms in the market. Oligopoly is a common market structure in many industries, such as the automobile, airline, and banking industries.
===Market Structure and Characteristics of Oligopoly === 
In an oligopoly, there are a few large firms that dominate the market. These firms are usually the largest in the industry and have a significant market share. The firms in an oligopoly are interdependent, meaning that the actions of one firm will affect the other firms in the market. This interdependence leads to strategic behavior, such as price fixing and collusion.
===Pricing Strategies in Oligopoly === 
In an oligopoly, firms must consider the pricing strategies of their competitors when setting their own prices. Firms may choose to set prices at a level that is higher than the market price in order to maximize profits. This is known as price discrimination. Firms may also choose to set prices at a level that is lower than the market price in order to gain market share. This is known as price skimming.
===Non-Price Competition in Oligopoly === 
In an oligopoly, firms may engage in non-price competition in order to gain market share. Non-price competition includes advertising, product differentiation, and product innovation. Firms may also engage in strategic behavior, such as price fixing and collusion, in order to gain an advantage over their competitors.
===Examples of Oligopoly in the Real World === 
Oligopoly is a common market structure in many industries, such as the automobile, airline, and banking industries. In the automobile industry, the Big Three automakers (Ford, GM, and Chrysler) dominate the market. In the airline industry, the four major airlines (American, Delta, United, and Southwest) control the majority of the market share. In the banking industry, the four largest banks (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo) control the majority of the market share.
