===Introduction to Defensive Interval Ratio === 
The Defensive Interval Ratio (DIR) is a financial metric used to measure the ability of a company to meet its short-term financial obligations. It is a measure of a company’s liquidity and is used to assess the risk of a company defaulting on its debt. The DIR is calculated by dividing the current assets of a company by its current liabilities.
===Definition of Defensive Interval Ratio === 
The Defensive Interval Ratio (DIR) is a financial metric used to measure the ability of a company to meet its short-term financial obligations. It is calculated by dividing the current assets of a company by its current liabilities. The higher the DIR, the better the company’s ability to meet its short-term financial obligations.
===Calculation of Defensive Interval Ratio === 
The Defensive Interval Ratio (DIR) is calculated by dividing the current assets of a company by its current liabilities. Current assets are assets that can be converted into cash within one year, such as cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. Current liabilities are obligations that must be paid within one year, such as accounts payable, taxes payable, and short-term debt.
===Benefits of Defensive Interval Ratio === 
The Defensive Interval Ratio (DIR) is a useful tool for assessing a company’s liquidity and risk of defaulting on its debt. A high DIR indicates that a company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, and is therefore less likely to default on its debt. A low DIR indicates that a company may not have sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, and is therefore more likely to default on its debt.
===Examples of Defensive Interval Ratio === 
For example, if a company has current assets of $100,000 and current liabilities of $50,000, its Defensive Interval Ratio would be 2.0 ($100,000 divided by $50,000). This indicates that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, and is therefore less likely to default on its debt.
===Conclusion === 
The Defensive Interval Ratio (DIR) is a financial metric used to measure the ability of a company to meet its short-term financial obligations. It is calculated by dividing the current assets of a company by its current liabilities. A high DIR indicates that a company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, and is therefore less likely to default on its debt. A low DIR indicates that a company may not have sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, and is therefore more likely to default on its debt. The DIR is a useful tool for assessing a company’s liquidity and risk of defaulting on its debt.
