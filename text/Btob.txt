Business-to-business (B2B) is a type of transaction that occurs between two or more businesses. It is a form of commerce that involves the exchange of goods and services between businesses. B2B transactions are typically conducted through a variety of channels, including online marketplaces, direct sales, and electronic data interchange (EDI). B2B transactions are often more complex than consumer-to-business (C2B) or business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions, as they involve multiple parties and often require more detailed negotiations.

• Wholesale: Wholesale transactions involve the sale of goods in bulk from one business to another. These transactions are typically conducted between manufacturers and distributors, or between distributors and retailers.

• Manufacturing: Manufacturing transactions involve the production of goods by one business for another. These transactions are typically conducted between manufacturers and their customers.

• Licensing: Licensing transactions involve the granting of rights to use a product or service from one business to another. These transactions are typically conducted between licensors and licensees.
