===Introduction to Debentures===

Debentures are a type of [[Debt Instrument|debt instrument]] that is used by companies to raise capital. They are issued by the company and are backed by the companyâ€™s assets. Debentures are typically unsecured, meaning that they are not backed by any collateral. They are usually issued for a fixed period of time and are paid back with interest. Debentures are a popular form of financing for companies because they are relatively easy to obtain and can be used to raise large amounts of capital.
===Types of Debentures===

There are several different types of debentures. The most common type is the convertible debenture, which can be converted into equity at a predetermined price. Convertible debentures are often used by companies to raise capital without having to issue new shares. Other types of debentures include non-convertible debentures, which are not convertible into equity, and secured debentures, which are backed by collateral.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of Debentures===

Debentures have several advantages. They are relatively easy to obtain and can be used to raise large amounts of capital. They also provide a steady stream of income for the company, as the interest payments are usually fixed. Additionally, debentures are not subject to the same regulations as other forms of debt, such as bonds.

However, debentures also have some disadvantages. They are not backed by any collateral, so if the company defaults on the loan, the debenture holders may not be able to recover their money. Additionally, debentures are not as liquid as other forms of debt, so they may be difficult to sell.
===Debenture Redemption===

Debentures are typically issued for a fixed period of time and are paid back with interest. The company must make regular payments to the debenture holders until the debenture is redeemed. The company may choose to redeem the debenture early, but this is not always possible. If the company is unable to redeem the debenture, it may be forced to default on the loan.
