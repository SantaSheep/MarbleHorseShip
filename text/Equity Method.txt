This method is used to ensure that the investor’s financial statements accurately reflect the investment’s performance.

Under the equity method, the investor records the initial investment in the investee at cost. The investor then records its share of the investee’s profits and losses in the investor’s income statement.

The investor’s share of the investee’s profits and losses is recorded in the investor’s equity account. The investor’s equity account is adjusted for any dividends received from the investee.
