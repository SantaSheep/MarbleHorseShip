===Introduction to Equity Method===

The equity method is an accounting technique used to account for investments in other companies. It is used when an investor has a significant influence over the investee, but does not have control. The equity method is used to record the investor’s share of the investee’s profits and losses, as well as the investor’s share of the investee’s assets and liabilities. The equity method is also used to record the investor’s share of any dividends paid by the investee.
===Accounting Treatment of Equity Method===

Under the equity method, the investor’s share of the investee’s profits and losses is recorded as an increase or decrease in the investor’s equity in the investee. The investor’s share of the investee’s assets and liabilities is recorded as an increase or decrease in the investor’s investment in the investee. The investor’s share of any dividends paid by the investee is recorded as a decrease in the investor’s equity in the investee.
