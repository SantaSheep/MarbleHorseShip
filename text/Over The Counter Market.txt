The Over The Counter (OTC) market is a decentralized market for trading securities that are not listed on a formal exchange. It is a type of market that is not regulated by a central authority, and instead is made up of a network of dealers who negotiate directly with each other.

Over the years, the OTC market has grown to include a variety of different types of securities, including bonds, derivatives, and foreign exchange. Today, the OTC market is one of the largest markets in the world, with an estimated daily trading volume of over $1 trillion.
