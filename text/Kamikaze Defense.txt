Kamikaze defense is a financial strategy used by companies to protect themselves from [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]]s. It is a defensive tactic that involves the company taking drastic measures to make itself less attractive to potential acquirers.

The term “kamikaze” is derived from the Japanese word for “divine wind” and is used to describe a last-ditch effort to protect oneself from an enemy.
