===How to Calculate LIFO Liquidation === 
To calculate LIFO liquidation, companies must first determine the cost of goods sold. This is done by subtracting the cost of goods sold from the beginning inventory.

The remaining amount is the value of inventory on hand.

The cost of goods sold is subtracted from the beginning inventory, leaving a remaining amount of $50,000. The value of inventory on hand is then calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from the ending inventory, which is $60,000. The remaining amount is the value of inventory on hand, which is $10,000.
