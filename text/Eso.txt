===Definition of Eso===

An Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to become owners of the company they work for. The company sets up a [[Trust Fund|trust fund]] that is funded with company stock. The trust then distributes the stock to the employees, who become owners of the company. The company can also contribute cash to the trust fund, which can be used to purchase additional stock.
===History of Eso===

The first ESOP was established in 1974 by Congress as part of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Since then, ESOPs have become increasingly popular as a way for companies to reward their employees and to provide them with a retirement plan that is tailored to their needs.
===Types of Eso===

There are two main types of ESOPs: leveraged and non-leveraged. Leveraged ESOPs are funded with borrowed money, while non-leveraged ESOPs are funded with cash contributions from the company. Leveraged ESOPs are more common, as they allow companies to provide larger contributions to the trust fund.
===Benefits of Eso===

There are many benefits to establishing an ESOP. For employees, ESOPs provide a way to become owners of the company they work for. This can be a great incentive for employees to stay with the company and to work hard. For companies, ESOPs can be a great way to reward employees and to provide them with a retirement plan that is tailored to their needs.
===Risks of Eso===

While there are many benefits to establishing an ESOP, there are also some risks. For example, if the companyâ€™s stock price falls, the value of the ESOP will also fall. Additionally, if the company goes bankrupt, the ESOP may be worthless.
