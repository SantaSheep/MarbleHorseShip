===Introduction to Double Declining Balance Depreciation Method (DDB) === 
The Double Declining Balance Depreciation Method (DDB) is a method of calculating the depreciation of an asset over its useful life. This method is used to calculate the amount of depreciation that can be claimed for tax purposes. It is also used to calculate the amount of depreciation that can be used to offset the cost of an asset for accounting purposes. The DDB method is based on the concept of accelerated depreciation, which means that the depreciation expense is higher in the early years of an asset’s life and decreases over time.
===Advantages of DDB === 
The main advantage of the DDB method is that it allows for a higher depreciation expense in the early years of an asset’s life. This can be beneficial for businesses that need to maximize their tax deductions in the early years of an asset’s life. Additionally, the DDB method can be used to match the depreciation expense to the expected usage of the asset. This can be beneficial for businesses that expect to use the asset more heavily in the early years of its life.
===Disadvantages of DDB === 
The main disadvantage of the DDB method is that it can result in a lower depreciation expense in the later years of an asset’s life. This can be a disadvantage for businesses that need to maximize their tax deductions in the later years of an asset’s life. Additionally, the DDB method can result in a higher depreciation expense in the early years of an asset’s life, which can be a disadvantage for businesses that expect to use the asset more heavily in the later years of its life.
===How to Calculate DDB === 
The DDB method is calculated by multiplying the cost of the asset by a depreciation rate. The depreciation rate is determined by dividing the double declining balance rate by the number of years in the asset’s useful life. For example, if the double declining balance rate is 20% and the asset has a useful life of 5 years, the depreciation rate would be 4%. The depreciation expense for each year would then be calculated by multiplying the cost of the asset by the depreciation rate.
===Examples of DDB === 
To illustrate the DDB method, let’s assume that a business purchases a machine for $10,000 with a useful life of 5 years and a double declining balance rate of 20%. The depreciation rate would be 4% and the depreciation expense for each year would be calculated as follows:
===Conclusion=== 
Year 2: $10,000 x 4% = $400
