===Introduction to Real GDP===

It is used to measure the total value of goods and services produced in an economy over a given period of time. Real GDP is an important indicator of [[Economic Growth|economic growth]] and is used to compare the performance of different economies.

Government spending includes spending by federal, state, and local governments on goods and services. Net exports are the difference between exports and imports.

Real GDP is calculated by taking the nominal GDP and adjusting it for inflation. Nominal GDP is the total value of goods and services produced in an economy over a given period of time. To calculate Real GDP, the nominal GDP is adjusted for inflation using a price index such as the [[Consumer Price Index|Consumer Price Index]] (CPI).
