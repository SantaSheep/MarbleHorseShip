===Introduction to Non Performing Assets===
Non-performing assets (NPAs) are loans or advances that have been classified by a lender or creditor as unlikely to be repaid in full. NPAs are a major concern for lenders and creditors, as they can have a significant impact on a [[Financial Institution|financial institution]]’s profitability and liquidity. As such, lenders and creditors must take steps to manage and reduce their NPAs in order to remain profitable and solvent.
===Definition of Non Performing Assets===
Non-performing assets are loans or advances that have been classified by a lender or creditor as unlikely to be repaid in full. This classification is based on the borrower’s failure to make payments on the loan or advance for a period of time, usually 90 days or more. NPAs are a major concern for lenders and creditors, as they can have a significant impact on a financial institution’s profitability and liquidity.
===Types of Non Performing Assets===
There are two main types of non-performing assets: secured and unsecured. Secured NPAs are loans or advances that are backed by collateral, such as a house or car. Unsecured NPAs are loans or advances that are not backed by collateral.
===Causes of Non Performing Assets===
There are several causes of non-performing assets. These include economic downturns, changes in the borrower’s financial situation, and changes in the lending environment. Economic downturns can lead to a decrease in the borrower’s ability to make payments on the loan or advance. Changes in the borrower’s financial situation, such as a job loss or medical emergency, can also lead to an inability to make payments. Changes in the lending environment, such as an increase in [[Interest Rate|interest rate]]s, can also lead to an increase in NPAs.
===Impact of Non Performing Assets===
Non-performing assets can have a significant impact on a financial institution’s profitability and liquidity. NPAs can reduce a financial institution’s profitability by reducing the amount of interest income it receives from borrowers. NPAs can also reduce a financial institution’s liquidity by reducing the amount of cash it has available to lend.
===Strategies to Manage Non Performing Assets===
There are several strategies that lenders and creditors can use to manage and reduce their NPAs. These include restructuring loans, selling NPAs to third parties, and writing off NPAs. Restructuring loans involves renegotiating the terms of the loan or advance in order to make it more affordable for the borrower. Selling NPAs to third parties involves selling the loan or advance to another lender or creditor. Writing off NPAs involves writing off the loan or advance as a loss.
