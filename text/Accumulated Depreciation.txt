===Definition of Accumulated Depreciation === 
Accumulated depreciation is the total amount of depreciation that has been recorded for an asset over its useful life. It is a non-cash expense that is used to reduce the value of an asset on the balance sheet. Accumulated depreciation is not a physical asset, but rather an accounting concept that is used to track the depreciation of an asset over its useful life.
===How Accumulated Depreciation is Calculated === 
Accumulated depreciation is calculated by taking the original cost of the asset and subtracting the estimated salvage value. This amount is then divided by the estimated useful life of the asset. The result is the annual depreciation expense for the asset. This amount is then multiplied by the number of years the asset has been in use to calculate the accumulated depreciation.
===Benefits of Accumulated Depreciation === 
Accumulated depreciation is an important concept for businesses to understand, as it can have a significant impact on the financial statements. By tracking the depreciation of an asset over its useful life, businesses can accurately report the value of the asset on the balance sheet. This helps to ensure that the financial statements are accurate and up-to-date.
===Examples of Accumulated Depreciation === 
One example of accumulated depreciation is a car. A car has a useful life of five years and a salvage value of $2,000. The original cost of the car is $20,000. The annual depreciation expense for the car is calculated by subtracting the salvage value from the original cost and dividing by the useful life. In this example, the annual depreciation expense is $3,600 ($20,000 - $2,000 = $18,000 / 5 years = $3,600). After five years, the accumulated depreciation for the car is $18,000 ($3,600 x 5 years = $18,000).
===Conclusion===

By tracking the depreciation of an asset over its useful life, businesses can accurately report the value of the asset on the balance sheet. This helps to ensure that the financial statements are accurate and up-to-date.
