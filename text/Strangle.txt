===Introduction to Strangle Options === 
Strangle options are a type of options trading strategy that involves buying both a call and a put option on the same underlying asset. The call option gives the trader the right to buy the asset at a certain price, while the put option gives the trader the right to sell the asset at a certain price. The goal of the strangle option strategy is to profit from a large move in either direction in the underlying asset.
===Advantages of Strangle Options === 
One of the main advantages of strangle options is that they allow traders to profit from a large move in either direction in the underlying asset. This means that traders can benefit from both bullish and bearish market conditions. Additionally, strangle options can be used to hedge against a large move in either direction, which can help to reduce risk.
===Disadvantages of Strangle Options === 
One of the main disadvantages of strangle options is that they require a large move in either direction in order to be profitable. This means that traders must be willing to take on a large amount of risk in order to potentially profit from the strategy. Additionally, strangle options can be expensive to trade, as they require the purchase of both a call and a put option.
===How to Trade Strangle Options === 
Trading strangle options is relatively straightforward. First, the trader must select an underlying asset and decide on the strike prices for the call and put options. The strike prices should be chosen such that they are far enough apart to allow for a large move in either direction in the underlying asset. Once the strike prices have been chosen, the trader can then purchase both a call and a put option on the underlying asset.
===Strategies for Trading Strangle Options === 
One of the most popular strategies for trading strangle options is the “long strangle” strategy. This strategy involves buying both a call and a put option with the same expiration date, but with different strike prices. The goal of this strategy is to profit from a large move in either direction in the underlying asset. Additionally, traders can also use the “short strangle” strategy, which involves selling both a call and a put option with the same expiration date, but with different strike prices. The goal of this strategy is to profit from a lack of movement in the underlying asset.
===Conclusion=== 
Strangle options are a type of options trading strategy that can be used to profit from a large move in either direction in the underlying asset. While strangle options can be profitable, they also require a large amount of risk and can be expensive to trade. Additionally, traders should be aware of the different strategies for trading strangle options, such as the long strangle and the short strangle.
