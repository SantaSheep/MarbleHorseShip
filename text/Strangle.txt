===Introduction to Strangle===
A strangle is an options trading strategy that involves buying both a [[Call Option|call option]] and a [[Put Option|put option]] on the same underlying asset. The call option gives the trader the right to buy the asset at a certain price, while the put option gives the trader the right to sell the asset at a certain price. The goal of the strangle is to profit from a large move in either direction in the underlying asset. The strangle is a popular strategy among options traders because it allows them to take advantage of large moves in the underlying asset without having to predict the direction of the move.
===Definition of Strangle===
A strangle is an options trading strategy that involves buying both a call option and a put option on the same underlying asset. The call option gives the trader the right to buy the asset at a certain price, while the put option gives the trader the right to sell the asset at a certain price. The goal of the strangle is to profit from a large move in either direction in the underlying asset. The strangle is a popular strategy among options traders because it allows them to take advantage of large moves in the underlying asset without having to predict the direction of the move.
===Types of Strangles===
There are two main types of strangles: long strangles and short strangles. A long strangle involves buying both a call option and a put option with the same expiration date but different [[Strike Price|strike price]]s. The strike price of the call option is higher than the strike price of the put option. A short strangle involves selling both a call option and a put option with the same expiration date but different strike prices. The strike price of the call option is lower than the strike price of the put option.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of Strangles===
The main advantage of the strangle is that it allows traders to take advantage of large moves in the underlying asset without having to predict the direction of the move. This makes the strangle a relatively low-risk strategy. The main disadvantage of the strangle is that it requires a large move in the underlying asset in order to be profitable. If the underlying asset does not move significantly, the trader may not be able to make a profit.
===Strategies for Trading Strangles===
When trading a strangle, it is important to choose the right strike prices for the call and put options. The strike prices should be chosen so that they are far enough away from the current price of the underlying asset to give the strangle a chance to be profitable, but not so far away that the options will expire worthless. It is also important to choose the right expiration date for the options. The expiration date should be chosen so that it gives the strangle enough time to be profitable, but not so long that the options will lose their value due to time decay.
