===Introduction to Vertical Analysis === 
Vertical analysis is a financial statement analysis technique that shows the relative size of different line items on a financial statement. It is also known as common-size analysis or statement of financial position analysis. Vertical analysis is used to compare the relative size of different line items on a financial statement over a period of time. It is a useful tool for investors and analysts to quickly identify changes in the financial position of a company.
===Benefits of Vertical Analysis === 
Vertical analysis is a useful tool for investors and analysts to quickly identify changes in the financial position of a company. It can be used to compare the relative size of different line items on a financial statement over a period of time. It can also be used to compare the financial position of different companies in the same industry. Vertical analysis can help investors and analysts identify potential problems with a company’s financial position.
===How to Calculate Vertical Analysis === 
Vertical analysis is calculated by dividing each line item on a financial statement by the total of the statement. This will give the percentage of each line item relative to the total. For example, if a company’s total assets are $100,000 and its total liabilities are $50,000, then the percentage of total assets to total liabilities is 50%.
===Example of Vertical Analysis === 
Let’s say a company has total assets of $100,000 and total liabilities of $50,000. Using vertical analysis, we can calculate the percentage of total assets to total liabilities. In this case, the percentage of total assets to total liabilities is 50%. This means that the company has twice as many assets as liabilities.
===Limitations of Vertical Analysis === 
Vertical analysis is a useful tool for investors and analysts to quickly identify changes in the financial position of a company. However, it has some limitations. Vertical analysis does not take into account the quality of the assets or liabilities. It also does not take into account the liquidity of the assets or liabilities.
===Conclusion=== 
Vertical analysis is a useful tool for investors and analysts to quickly identify changes in the financial position of a company. It can be used to compare the relative size of different line items on a financial statement over a period of time. It can also be used to compare the financial position of different companies in the same industry. However, it has some limitations and should not be used as the sole basis for making investment decisions.
