===Benefits of Isoquant Curve === 
Conclusion - The isoquant curve is a useful tool for understanding the concept of diminishing returns. It helps to illustrate the trade-offs between different inputs and the resulting output. It also helps to identify the most efficient combination of inputs for a given level of output. However, it is limited in that it does not take into account the quality of the inputs or the cost of the inputs.
