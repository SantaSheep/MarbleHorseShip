===Introduction to Zombie Debt===
Zombie debt is a term used to describe debt that has been sold, transferred, or otherwise passed on to a third party, such as a debt collection agency, after the original creditor has written off the debt as uncollectible. Zombie debt is a growing problem in the United States, as debt collectors often attempt to collect on debts that are no longer legally enforceable. This article will provide an overview of zombie debt, including its definition, causes, impact, and strategies for dealing with it.
===Definition of Zombie Debt===
Zombie debt is a term used to describe debt that has been sold, transferred, or otherwise passed on to a third party, such as a debt collection agency, after the original creditor has written off the debt as uncollectible. This type of debt is often referred to as “zombie debt” because it is “dead” in the eyes of the original creditor, but is still being pursued by a third party. Zombie debt can include any type of debt, such as [[Credit Card|credit card]] debt, medical debt, student loan debt, or even debt from a utility company.
===Causes of Zombie Debt===
There are several causes of zombie debt. One of the most common causes is when a creditor sells off its uncollectible debt to a third-party debt collector. This is often done in order to recoup some of the money that was lost when the debt was written off. Another cause of zombie debt is when a debt collector purchases a debt from a third-party debt buyer. Debt buyers purchase debt from creditors for pennies on the dollar and then attempt to collect on the debt.
===Impact of Zombie Debt===
The impact of zombie debt can be significant. For one, it can damage a person’s credit score if the debt is reported to the credit bureaus. Additionally, it can lead to harassing phone calls and letters from debt collectors, as well as legal action if the debt is not paid. Finally, it can lead to wage garnishment if the debt is not resolved.
===Strategies for Dealing with Zombie Debt===
There are several strategies for dealing with zombie debt. The first is to contact the original creditor and request proof of the debt. This can help to determine if the debt is still legally enforceable. If the debt is not legally enforceable, the debt collector must cease collection efforts. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the [[Statute Of Limitations|statute of limitations]] for debt collection in your state, as this can help to determine if the debt is still legally enforceable. Finally, it is important to be aware of your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which can help protect you from unfair debt collection practices.

It is important to be aware of the causes, impact, and strategies for dealing with zombie debt in order to protect yourself from unfair debt collection practices.
