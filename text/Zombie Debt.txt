===Introduction to Zombie Debt - What is Zombie Debt?=== 
Zombie debt is a term used to describe debt that has been sold to a third-party debt collector, usually after the original creditor has written off the debt as uncollectible. Zombie debt is often sold for pennies on the dollar, and the debt collector then attempts to collect the full amount from the consumer. Zombie debt can be difficult to identify and can have a significant impact on a consumer’s credit score.

Zombie debt is created when a creditor or lender writes off a debt as uncollectible and then sells the debt to a third-party debt collector. The debt collector then attempts to collect the full amount from the consumer. This can happen with any type of debt, including credit card debt, medical debt, student loan debt, and even utility bills.

Zombie debt can have a significant impact on a consumer’s credit score. If the debt collector is successful in collecting the debt, it will be reported to the credit bureaus and will appear on the consumer’s credit report. This can have a negative impact on the consumer’s credit score, as the debt will be reported as a new debt and will be factored into the consumer’s credit utilization ratio.
