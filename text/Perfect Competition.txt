===Introduction to Perfect Competition===

Perfect competition is an economic model of market structure in which there are many buyers and sellers, all of whom have perfect knowledge of the market and are able to freely enter and exit the market. This type of market structure is characterized by a large number of small firms, each of which has a negligible impact on the market price. Perfect competition is often used as a benchmark for comparison with other market structures, such as monopoly and oligopoly.
===Characteristics of Perfect Competition===

• Many buyers and sellers: There must be a large number of buyers and sellers in the market, each of which has a negligible impact on the market price.

• Perfect knowledge: All buyers and sellers must have perfect knowledge of the market, including the prices of all goods and services.

• Free entry and exit: There must be no barriers to entry or exit for buyers and sellers.

• Homogeneous products: All products must be identical, meaning that there is no differentiation between products.
