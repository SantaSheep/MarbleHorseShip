===Definition of Earnest Money===
Earnest money is a deposit made by a buyer to a seller as part of a real estate transaction. It is a way for the buyer to demonstrate their commitment to the purchase and to show that they are serious about the transaction. The earnest money is typically held in an escrow account until the transaction is completed. The amount of earnest money is usually a percentage of the purchase price and is typically non-refundable.
===Types of Earnest Money===
There are two main types of earnest money: cash and non-cash. Cash earnest money is a deposit of cash or a cashierâ€™s check made by the buyer to the seller. Non-cash earnest money is a deposit of something other than cash, such as stocks, bonds, or other securities.
===Benefits of Earnest Money===
The primary benefit of earnest money is that it provides a measure of security for both the buyer and the seller. For the buyer, it shows that they are serious about the purchase and that they are willing to put up some money to demonstrate their commitment.
