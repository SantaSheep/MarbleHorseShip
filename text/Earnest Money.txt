===What is Earnest Money? === 
Earnest money is a deposit made to a seller that represents a buyer's good faith to buy a home. The money gives the buyer extra time to get financing and conduct the title search, property inspection, and other steps necessary to complete the sale. It also helps to bind the parties to the contract and serves as a financial penalty if the buyer defaults on the agreement.
===How Does Earnest Money Work? === 
When a buyer makes an offer on a home, they will typically include an earnest money deposit. This deposit is usually 1-2% of the purchase price and is held in an escrow account until the sale is finalized. The buyer will typically provide a check or wire transfer to the seller or their real estate agent. The money is then held in an escrow account until the sale is finalized.
===Benefits of Earnest Money === 
Earnest money provides several benefits to both buyers and sellers. For buyers, it gives them extra time to get financing and conduct the necessary inspections and title searches. It also serves as a financial penalty if the buyer defaults on the agreement. For sellers, it shows that the buyer is serious about the purchase and helps to bind the parties to the contract.
===When is Earnest Money Due? === 
The earnest money deposit is typically due when the purchase agreement is signed. The buyer will typically provide a check or wire transfer to the seller or their real estate agent. The money is then held in an escrow account until the sale is finalized.
===What Happens if You Donâ€™t Pay Earnest Money? === 
If the buyer fails to pay the earnest money deposit, the seller can terminate the purchase agreement. The seller may also be able to keep the deposit if the buyer defaults on the agreement.
===Example of Earnest Money in Action=== 
For example, a buyer makes an offer on a home for $200,000 and includes an earnest money deposit of $2,000. The buyer provides a check or wire transfer to the seller or their real estate agent. The money is then held in an escrow account until the sale is finalized. If the buyer defaults on the agreement, the seller can keep the earnest money deposit.
