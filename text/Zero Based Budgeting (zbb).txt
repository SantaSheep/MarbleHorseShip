===Introduction to Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) === 
Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a budgeting system that requires each expense to be justified for each period. This means that all expenses must be approved and allocated from the beginning of the budgeting period. This is in contrast to traditional budgeting, which allocates funds based on the previous yearâ€™s budget. ZBB is a popular budgeting system used by many businesses and organizations.
===Benefits of ZBB === 
The primary benefit of ZBB is that it forces budgeters to evaluate each expense and determine whether it is necessary. This helps to ensure that funds are allocated to the most important areas and that wasteful spending is avoided. Additionally, ZBB can help to identify areas where costs can be reduced or eliminated. This can lead to significant cost savings over time.
===Challenges of ZBB === 
One of the main challenges of ZBB is that it can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. This is because each expense must be justified and approved from the beginning of the budgeting period. Additionally, ZBB can be difficult to implement in organizations that are used to traditional budgeting.
===How to Implement ZBB === 
The first step in implementing ZBB is to create a budget template. This template should include all of the expenses that need to be justified and allocated. Once the template is created, the budgeters should review each expense and determine whether it is necessary. If an expense is deemed unnecessary, it should be eliminated or reduced. Once all of the expenses have been reviewed, the budgeters should allocate funds accordingly.
===Examples of ZBB === 
One example of ZBB is the budgeting system used by the US government. The US government uses ZBB to ensure that all expenses are justified and allocated from the beginning of the budgeting period. Additionally, many businesses and organizations use ZBB to ensure that funds are allocated to the most important areas.
===Conclusion=== 
Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a budgeting system that requires each expense to be justified for each period. This system can help to ensure that funds are allocated to the most important areas and that wasteful spending is avoided. Additionally, ZBB can help to identify areas where costs can be reduced or eliminated. While ZBB can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, it can lead to significant cost savings over time.
