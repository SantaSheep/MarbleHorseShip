===Introduction to the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility === 
The law of diminishing marginal utility is an economic principle that states that as a person consumes more of a good or service, the satisfaction they receive from each additional unit of that good or service will decrease. This law is based on the idea that people have limited resources and that they will eventually reach a point where they are no longer able to benefit from consuming more of a good or service. This law is important to understand when making financial decisions, as it can help to inform how much of a good or service a person should purchase.
===Examples of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility === 
One of the most common examples of the law of diminishing marginal utility is the consumption of food. As a person eats more of a particular food, the satisfaction they receive from each additional bite will decrease. This is because the personâ€™s stomach can only hold so much food and eventually they will reach a point where they are no longer able to benefit from consuming more of the food.
