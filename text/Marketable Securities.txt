Investing in marketable securities also has some disadvantages. First, they are subject to market risk, meaning their value can fluctuate with changes in the market. Second, they are not insured by the government, so investors can lose their entire investment if the issuing entity defaults on its obligations. Third, they are subject to taxes, such as [[Capital Gain|capital gain]]s taxes, which can reduce the overall [[Return On Investment|return on investment]].

Marketable securities are financial instruments that can be easily bought and sold in the open market. They offer the potential for higher returns than other types of investments, but they are also subject to market risk and taxes.
