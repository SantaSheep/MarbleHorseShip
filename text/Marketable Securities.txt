===Introduction to Marketable Securities === 
Marketable securities are investments that can be quickly converted into cash. They are typically traded on a public exchange and are highly liquid. Marketable securities include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other investments. They are a popular choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and generate income.
===Types of Marketable Securities === 
The most common types of marketable securities are stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Stocks are shares of ownership in a company. Bonds are debt instruments issued by governments or corporations.
