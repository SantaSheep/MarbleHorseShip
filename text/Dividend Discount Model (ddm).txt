===Introduction to Dividend Discount Model (DDM) === 
The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is a financial valuation model used to calculate the intrinsic value of a company’s stock. It is based on the premise that the value of a stock is equal to the present value of all future dividends that the company will pay out. The DDM is a popular tool used by investors to determine whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued.
===Overview of DDM Components === 
The DDM consists of three main components: the dividend growth rate, the required rate of return, and the current dividend. The dividend growth rate is the rate at which the company’s dividends are expected to grow over time. The required rate of return is the rate of return that investors expect to receive from their investment. The current dividend is the most recent dividend paid out by the company.
===Calculating the Cost of Equity with DDM === 
The cost of equity is the rate of return that investors require in order to invest in a company’s stock. The cost of equity can be calculated using the DDM by taking the current dividend and dividing it by the required rate of return. This will give you the present value of the future dividends that the company will pay out.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of DDM === 
The DDM is a simple and straightforward model that can be used to quickly estimate the intrinsic value of a company’s stock. It is also relatively easy to understand and use. However, the DDM does not take into account other factors such as the company’s future growth prospects or the risk associated with investing in the company’s stock.
===Example of DDM in Practice === 
Let’s say that a company has a current dividend of $1.00 and a required rate of return of 10%. Using the DDM, we can calculate the cost of equity by dividing the current dividend by the required rate of return. In this case, the cost of equity would be $10.00.
===Conclusion=== 
The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is a financial valuation model used to calculate the intrinsic value of a company’s stock. It is based on the premise that the value of a stock is equal to the present value of all future dividends that the company will pay out. The DDM consists of three main components: the dividend growth rate, the required rate of return, and the current dividend. The cost of equity can be calculated using the DDM by taking the current dividend and dividing it by the required rate of return. The DDM is a simple and straightforward model that can be used to quickly estimate the intrinsic value of a company’s stock, but it does not take into account other factors such as the company’s future growth prospects or the risk associated with investing in the company’s stock.
