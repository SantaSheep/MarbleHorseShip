===Introduction to Economic Order Quantity===
Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a model used to determine the optimal order quantity that a company should purchase in order to minimize the total cost of inventory. It is a decision-making tool used to determine the most cost-effective order size for a company’s inventory. The EOQ model takes into account the cost of ordering and the cost of holding inventory, and helps companies determine the optimal order size that will minimize their total inventory costs.
===Factors Affecting Economic Order Quantity===
There are several factors that affect the EOQ model. These include the cost of ordering, the cost of holding inventory, the demand for the product, the lead time for ordering, and the [[Cost Of Capital|cost of capital]]. The cost of ordering is the cost associated with placing an order for inventory, such as the cost of shipping and handling. The cost of holding inventory is the cost associated with storing and maintaining inventory, such as the cost of storage space and insurance. The demand for the product is the amount of the product that is expected to be sold over a given period of time. The lead time for ordering is the amount of time it takes for an order to be received and processed. The cost of capital is the cost associated with borrowing money to finance the purchase of inventory.
===Calculating Economic Order Quantity===
The EOQ model is used to calculate the optimal order quantity for a company’s inventory. The formula for calculating the EOQ is: EOQ = √(2A/), where A is the annual demand for the product and  is the cost of ordering and holding inventory. The EOQ model takes into account the cost of ordering and the cost of holding inventory, and helps companies determine the optimal order size that will minimize their total inventory costs.
===Benefits of Economic Order Quantity===
The EOQ model provides several benefits to companies. It helps companies determine the optimal order size that will minimize their total inventory costs. It also helps companies reduce their inventory costs by reducing the amount of inventory they need to purchase and store. Additionally, the EOQ model helps companies reduce their lead times by ensuring that orders are placed in a timely manner. Finally, the EOQ model helps companies reduce their risk of stockouts by ensuring that they have enough inventory on hand to meet customer demand.
===Conclusion===
Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a model used to determine the optimal order quantity that a company should purchase in order to minimize the total cost of inventory. The EOQ model takes into account the cost of ordering and the cost of holding inventory, and helps companies determine the optimal order size that will minimize their total inventory costs. The EOQ model provides several benefits to companies, including reducing inventory costs, reducing lead times, and reducing the risk of stockouts. By using the EOQ model, companies can ensure that they are pur
