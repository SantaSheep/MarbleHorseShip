===Introduction to Working Capital Management === 
Working capital management is the process of managing a company’s short-term assets and liabilities to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations. It is an important part of financial management and involves the careful balancing of current assets and liabilities to ensure that the company has enough cash to meet its short-term obligations. Working capital management is essential for any business, as it helps to ensure that the company has enough liquidity to pay its bills and meet its short-term financial obligations.
===Understanding Working Capital === 
Working capital is the difference between a company’s current assets and its current liabilities. It is a measure of a company’s liquidity and is used to determine the company’s ability to pay its short-term obligations. Working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. A positive working capital indicates that the company has enough liquidity to meet its short-term obligations, while a negative working capital indicates that the company does not have enough liquidity to meet its short-term obligations.
===Calculating Working Capital === 
Working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. Current assets include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other assets that can be converted into cash within one year. Current liabilities include accounts payable, short-term debt, and other liabilities that must be paid within one year.
