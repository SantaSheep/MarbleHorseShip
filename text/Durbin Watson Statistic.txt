===Introduction to Durbin Watson Statistic === 
The Durbin Watson statistic is a statistical test used to detect autocorrelation in a linear regression model. It is a measure of the correlation between the residuals of a regression model. The Durbin Watson statistic is used to detect the presence of autocorrelation in a linear regression model, which can lead to incorrect estimates of the model parameters.
===What is the Durbin Watson Statistic? === 
The Durbin Watson statistic is a measure of the correlation between the residuals of a linear regression model. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between the residuals and dividing it by the sum of the squared residuals. The Durbin Watson statistic ranges from 0 to 4, with a value of 2 indicating no autocorrelation.
===How is the Durbin Watson Statistic Used? === 
The Durbin Watson statistic is used to detect the presence of autocorrelation in a linear regression model. Autocorrelation occurs when the residuals of a regression model are correlated with each other. This can lead to incorrect estimates of the model parameters, which can lead to incorrect predictions. The Durbin Watson statistic can be used to detect the presence of autocorrelation and to determine if the model needs to be adjusted.
===Examples of Durbin Watson Statistic === 
The Durbin Watson statistic can be used to detect autocorrelation in a variety of linear regression models. For example, it can be used to detect autocorrelation in a linear regression model that is used to predict stock prices. It can also be used to detect autocorrelation in a linear regression model that is used to predict housing prices.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of Durbin Watson Statistic === 
The Durbin Watson statistic has several advantages. It is easy to calculate and interpret, and it can be used to detect autocorrelation in a variety of linear regression models. However, it has some disadvantages. It is not always reliable, and it can be affected by outliers.
===Conclusion === 
The Durbin Watson statistic is a measure of the correlation between the residuals of a linear regression model. It is used to detect the presence of autocorrelation in a linear regression model, which can lead to incorrect estimates of the model parameters. The Durbin Watson statistic has several advantages, but it also has some disadvantages.
