===Introduction to Coefficient of Variation (CV) === 
Coefficient of Variation (CV) is a measure of the relative variability of a set of data. It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of a set of data by its mean. The resulting number is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage. CV is used to compare the variability of different sets of data, and is especially useful when comparing data sets with different units of measurement.
