Term [[Life Insurance|life insurance]] is a type of life insurance policy that provides coverage for a specific period of time, usually between 10 and 30 years.

Decreasing term life insurance, on the other hand, provides a death benefit that decreases over time. This type of policy is often used to cover a debt, such as a mortgage, that is expected to decrease over time.
