===Introduction to Gross National Income (GNI) === 
Gross National Income (GNI) is a measure of the total income earned by a country’s citizens and businesses. It is a key indicator of a country’s economic performance and is used to compare the economic performance of different countries. GNI is also used to measure the progress of a country’s economic development.
===Components of GNI === 
GNI is composed of four main components: wages and salaries, profits, rents, and interest. Wages and salaries are the income earned by workers for their labor. Profits are the income earned by businesses from their operations. Rents are the income earned by landlords from the rental of their properties. Interest is the income earned by lenders from the lending of their money.
===Calculation of GNI === 
GNI is calculated by adding up the total income earned by a country’s citizens and businesses. This includes wages and salaries, profits, rents, and interest. The total income is then adjusted for taxes and subsidies, and the resulting figure is the GNI.
===Benefits of GNI === 
GNI is a useful measure of a country’s economic performance. It provides a comprehensive picture of a country’s economic activity and can be used to compare the economic performance of different countries. GNI is also used to measure the progress of a country’s economic development.
===Challenges of GNI === 
One of the main challenges of GNI is that it does not take into account the distribution of income within a country. This means that GNI does not provide an accurate picture of the economic well-being of a country’s citizens. Additionally, GNI does not take into account the economic activity of non-residents, which can lead to an inaccurate picture of a country’s economic performance.
===Conclusion=== 
Gross National Income (GNI) is a measure of the total income earned by a country’s citizens and businesses. It is a key indicator of a country’s economic performance and is used to compare the economic performance of different countries. GNI is composed of four main components: wages and salaries, profits, rents, and interest. GNI is a useful measure of a country’s economic performance, but it does not take into account the distribution of income within a country or the economic activity of non-residents.
