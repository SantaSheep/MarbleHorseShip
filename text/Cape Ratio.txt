The Cape Ratio, also known as the Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings Ratio, is a financial metric used to measure the value of a company’s stock relative to its earnings. It is a long-term measure of a company’s stock price and is used to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. The Cape Ratio is a useful tool for investors who are looking to make long-term investments in a company’s stock.
===Definition of Cape Ratio===

The Cape Ratio is calculated by dividing the price of a company’s stock by the average of its earnings over the past 10 years. This average is adjusted for inflation, which helps to account for changes in the value of money over time. The result of this calculation is the Cape Ratio, which is expressed as a number. A higher Cape Ratio indicates that the stock is overvalued, while a lower Cape Ratio indicates that the stock is undervalued.
===Uses of Cape Ratio===

The Cape Ratio is used by investors to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. It is also used to compare the value of different stocks, as well as to compare the value of a stock to the overall market. The Cape Ratio can also be used to identify potential investment opportunities, as stocks with a low Cape Ratio may be undervalued and therefore offer a good investment opportunity.
