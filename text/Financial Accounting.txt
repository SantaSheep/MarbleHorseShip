===Introduction to Financial Accounting===
Financial accounting is the process of recording, summarizing, and reporting financial transactions of a business. It is the language of business and is used to communicate the financial position of a company to its stakeholders. Financial accounting is a critical component of any business, as it provides the necessary information to make informed decisions.
===Overview of Financial Accounting Principles===
Financial accounting is based on a set of principles that guide the recording and reporting of financial transactions. These principles include the accrual basis of accounting, the matching principle, the cost principle, the [[Going Concern|going concern]] principle, and the materiality principle. The accrual basis of accounting requires that transactions be recorded when they occur, not when cash is exchanged. The matching principle requires that expenses be matched with the revenues they generate. The cost principle requires that assets be recorded at their original cost. The going concern principle assumes that a business will continue to operate in the foreseeable future. The materiality principle states that only transactions that are material to the [[Financial Statements|financial statements]] should be recorded.
===Financial Accounting Standards===
Financial [[Accounting Standard|accounting standard]]s are established by the  Board (FASB). These standards provide guidance on how financial transactions should be recorded and reported. The FASB has established a set of Generally Accepted [[Accounting Principles|Accounting Principles]] (GAAP) that must be followed by all companies. These principles provide a framework for financial reporting and ensure that financial statements are presented in a consistent and reliable manner.
===Financial Accounting Processes===
Financial accounting processes involve the recording, summarizing, and reporting of financial transactions. The recording process involves the identification, measurement, and recording of financial transactions. The summarizing process involves the aggregation of financial transactions into meaningful financial statements. The reporting process involves the preparation of financial statements and other reports that are used to communicate the financial position of a company.
===Financial Accounting Reports===
Financial accounting reports are used to communicate the financial position of a company to its stakeholders. These reports include the [[Balance Sheet|balance sheet]], [[Income Statement|income statement]], statement of [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]s, and statement of changes in equity. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and equity at a given point in time. The income statement provides information about a company’s revenues and expenses over a period of time. The statement of cash flows provides information about a company’s cash inflows and outflows over a period of time. The statement of changes in equity provides information about a company’s changes in equity over a period of time.
