===Introduction to Mixed Economic System===
A mixed economic system is an economic system that combines elements of both a [[Market Economy|market economy]] and a [[Command Economy|command economy]]. It is a system in which both the [[Private Sector|private sector]] and the public sector exist, and both are allowed to play a role in the production and distribution of goods and services. This type of economic system is also known as a dual economy, or a mixed market economy.
===Characteristics of a Mixed Economic System===
The characteristics of a mixed economic system include the presence of both private and public ownership of resources, the presence of both market and non-market mechanisms for allocating resources, and the presence of both private and public sector involvement in the production and distribution of goods and services.
