===Introduction to Gearing===

Gearing is a financial term that refers to the use of borrowed funds to increase the potential return of an investment. It is a way of leveraging the capital of an investor to increase the potential [[Return On Investment|return on investment]]. Gearing is also known as leverage, and it is a common practice in the financial world. Gearing can be used to increase the return on investment, but it also carries with it a greater risk of loss.
===Types of Gearing===

There are two main types of gearing: debt and equity. Debt gearing involves borrowing money to invest in an asset, such as a stock or bond. Equity gearing involves using equity, such as shares, to increase the potential return on investment. Both types of gearing can be used to increase the potential return on investment, but they also carry with them different levels of risk.
===Advantages and Disadvantages of Gearing===

The main advantage of gearing is that it can increase the potential return on investment. Gearing can also be used to reduce the amount of capital required to invest in an asset. However, gearing also carries with it a greater risk of loss. If the investment does not perform as expected, the investor may be liable for the full amount of the loan.
===Calculating Gearing===

Gearing can be calculated by dividing the amount of borrowed funds by the total amount of capital invested. For example, if an investor borrows $10,000 to invest in a stock and the total amount of capital invested is $20,000, the [[Gearing Ratio|gearing ratio]] would be 0.5. This means that the investor has borrowed 50% of the total capital invested.
