===Introduction to Gearing - What is Gearing?=== 
Gearing is a financial term used to describe the use of borrowed funds to increase the potential return of an investment. Gearing is also known as leverage, and it is a common practice used by investors to increase their returns. Gearing involves borrowing money to purchase an asset, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. The borrowed funds are then used to increase the potential return of the investment. Gearing can be used to increase the potential return of an investment, but it also carries a certain amount of risk.
===Types of Gearing - Leverage, Margin, and Derivatives=== 
Gearing can be achieved through a variety of methods, including leverage, margin, and derivatives. Leverage is the use of borrowed funds to purchase an asset. Margin is the use of borrowed funds to purchase a portion of an asset. Derivatives are financial instruments that are derived from an underlying asset. These instruments can be used to increase the potential return of an investment.

Additionally, gearing carries leverage risk, which is the risk that the borrowed funds will not be repaid.
===Strategies for Gearing - Hedging and Diversification===
