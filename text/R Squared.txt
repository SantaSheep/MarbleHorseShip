===Introduction to R-Squared === 
R-squared is a statistical measure that is used to assess the goodness of fit of a regression model. It is also known as the coefficient of determination and is used to measure the strength of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables in a regression model. R-squared is a widely used metric in finance and economics, and it is important to understand how it works and what it can tell us about a regression model.
===What is R-Squared? === 
R-squared is a measure of how well a regression model fits the data. It is calculated by taking the ratio of the variance of the predicted values to the variance of the actual values. The higher the R-squared value, the better the model fits the data. R-squared values range from 0 to 1, with 1 being a perfect fit.
===How is R-Squared Calculated? === 
R-squared is calculated by taking the ratio of the variance of the predicted values to the variance of the actual values. The formula for calculating R-squared is as follows:
