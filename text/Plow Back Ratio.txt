===Introduction to Plowback Ratio===

The plowback ratio is a financial metric used to measure the amount of [[Net Income|net income]] that a company reinvests into its business operations. It is a useful tool for investors to assess the financial health of a company and its ability to generate future profits. The plowback ratio is also known as the [[Retention Ratio|retention ratio]] or the internal growth rate.
===Definition of Plowback Ratio===

The plowback ratio is calculated by dividing the net income of a company by its total equity. It is expressed as a percentage and is used to measure the amount of net income that a company reinvests into its business operations. The higher the plowback ratio, the more money a company is reinvesting into its operations.
===Calculation of Plowback Ratio===

The plowback ratio is calculated by dividing the net income of a company by its total equity. The formula for calculating the plowback ratio is as follows:

Plowback Ratio = Net Income / Total Equity

For example, if a company has a net income of $100,000 and total equity of $500,000, the plowback ratio would be 20%.
===Uses of Plowback Ratio===

The plowback ratio is a useful tool for investors to assess the financial health of a company and its ability to generate future profits. A high plowback ratio indicates that a company is reinvesting a large portion of its profits into its operations, which can lead to increased profits in the future. A low plowback ratio, on the other hand, indicates that a company is not reinvesting enough of its profits into its operations, which could lead to decreased profits in the future.
===Limitations of Plowback Ratio===

The plowback ratio is a useful tool for investors, but it does have some limitations. For example, the plowback ratio does not take into account the quality of the investments that a company is making. A company may be reinvesting a large portion of its profits, but if the investments are not profitable, the plowback ratio will not accurately reflect the financial health of the company.

The plowback ratio is a useful tool for investors to assess the financial health of a company and its ability to generate future profits. It is calculated by dividing the net income of a company by its total equity and is expressed as a percentage.
