===Introduction to Residual Standard Deviation===

Residual [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] (RSD) is a measure of the variability of a set of data points from a regression line. It is used to measure the accuracy of a regression model and to compare different models. RSD is also known as the [[Standard Error|standard error]] of the regression.
===Definition of Residual Standard Deviation===

RSD is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values of the regression line. It is a measure of the variability of the data points from the regression line.
===Uses of Residual Standard Deviation===

RSD is used to measure the accuracy of a regression model. It is also used to compare different models and to determine which model is the best fit for the data. RSD can also be used to identify outliers in the data set.
===Calculating Residual Standard Deviation===

RSD is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values of the regression line. The formula for calculating RSD is:

RSD = √[(y1 - ŷ1)2 + (y2 - ŷ2)2 + ... + (yn - ŷn)2]

Where y1, y2, ..., yn are the observed values and ŷ1, ŷ2, ..., ŷn are the predicted values of the regression line.
===Examples of Residual Standard Deviation===

For example, consider a data set with 10 observations and a regression line with a slope of 2 and an intercept of 1. The observed values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The predicted values of the regression line are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21. The RSD for this data set is calculated as follows:

RSD = √[(1 - 3)2 + (2 - 5)2 + (3 - 7)2 + (4 - 9)2 + (5 - 11)2 + (6 - 13)2 + (7 - 15)2 + (8 - 17)2 + (9 - 19)2 + (10 - 21)2]

RSD = √[4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 + 121]

RSD = √735

RSD = 27.2
===Conclusion===

In conclusion, residual standard deviation is a measure of the variability of a set of data points from a regression line. It is used to measure the accuracy of a regression model and to compare different models. RSD is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values of the regression line
