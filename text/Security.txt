===Introduction to Security===
Security is a [[Financial Instrument|financial instrument]] that represents a claim on the assets or income of a company or government. It is a form of investment that provides the holder with a right to receive a certain amount of money or other assets in the future. Securities are typically issued by companies or governments to raise capital for various purposes, such as to finance operations, to fund research and development, or to expand their business. They can also be used to provide liquidity to investors, allowing them to buy and sell the security without having to wait for the company or government to issue new shares.
===Types of Securities===
There are several different types of securities, each with its own characteristics and risks. The most common types of securities are stocks, bonds, and derivatives.

These regulations are enforced by government agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States. These regulations include requirements for disclosure of information about the security, restrictions on [[Insider Trading|insider trading]], and requirements for the registration of securities with the SEC.

===Security Trading===
Securities are typically traded on organized exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Nasdaq.
