===Introduction to Commodities===

Commodities are physical goods that are used as inputs in the production of other goods and services. They are typically traded on exchanges and are used as a form of investment. Commodities are typically divided into two categories: hard commodities and soft commodities. Hard commodities are those that are mined or extracted from the earth, such as gold, silver, oil, and copper. Soft commodities are those that are grown or produced, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, and coffee.
===Types of Commodities===

Hard commodities are typically divided into two categories: precious metals and energy. Precious metals include gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. Energy commodities include crude oil, natural gas, and heating oil. Soft commodities are typically divided into two categories: agricultural commodities and livestock commodities. Agricultural commodities include wheat, corn, soybeans, and coffee. Livestock commodities include live cattle, pork bellies, and feeder cattle.
===Commodity Markets===

Commodity markets are exchanges where commodities are traded. The most well-known commodity markets are the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). These exchanges are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Other exchanges include the London Metal Exchange (LME), the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM), and the Dubai Gold and Commodity Exchange (DGCX).
===Commodity Trading Strategies===

Commodity trading strategies vary depending on the type of commodity being traded. For example, a trader may use a long-term strategy for trading gold, while a short-term strategy may be used for trading crude oil. Other strategies include spread trading, which involves buying and selling two different commodities at the same time, and arbitrage, which involves taking advantage of price discrepancies between two different markets.
