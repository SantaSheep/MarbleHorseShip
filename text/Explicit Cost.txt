===Introduction to Explicit Cost === 
Explicit cost is a type of cost that is directly associated with a business’s operations. It is a cost that is directly incurred by the business and is easily identifiable. Explicit costs are also known as out-of-pocket costs, as they are costs that are paid out of the business’s pocket. Examples of explicit costs include wages, rent, utilities, and materials. These costs are necessary for the business to operate and are typically recorded in the company’s financial statements.
===Examples of Explicit Cost === 
Explicit costs are costs that are directly associated with a business’s operations. Examples of explicit costs include wages, rent, utilities, and materials. Wages are the cost of paying employees for their work. Rent is the cost of leasing or renting a space for the business to operate. Utilities are the cost of electricity, water, and other services that are necessary for the business to operate. Materials are the cost of purchasing the raw materials needed to produce goods or services.
===Types of Explicit Cost === 
Explicit costs can be divided into two main categories: fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are costs that remain the same regardless of the level of production or sales. Examples of fixed costs include rent, insurance, and salaries. Variable costs are costs that vary depending on the level of production or sales. Examples of variable costs include materials, labor, and shipping.
===Calculating Explicit Cost === 
Explicit costs can be calculated by adding up all of the costs associated with a business’s operations. This includes wages, rent, utilities, and materials. To calculate explicit costs, the business must first determine the total amount of money spent on each cost. Then, the total amount of money spent on each cost must be added together to get the total explicit cost.

By understanding their explicit costs, businesses can make informed decisions about how to allocate their resources and manage their finances. Knowing explicit costs also helps businesses to identify areas where they can reduce costs and increase profits.
